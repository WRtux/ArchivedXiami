K-Pop","description":"韩国流行音乐（英语：K-POP，朝鲜语：가요）是指源自韩国的流行音乐，包括有舞曲、现代节奏蓝调、流行电音、嘻哈音乐，是一音乐种类。\n\n历史\n\n早期韩国流行音乐\n韩国演歌是朝鲜半岛的传统流行音乐，被称为朝鲜半岛最早期的流行音乐。韩国人声称韩国演歌早在日治时期前就已出现，尽管与日本演歌的音乐很相似，但两者并不相同。\n韩国演歌据说源于狐步舞（Foxtrot）的音乐，所以它的韩语名称亦取自狐步舞的英语的最后几个音节，而这种舞踏有简单轻快的乐曲。\n\n1990s: 多样化\n在1992年出道的徐太志和孩子们是整个韩国流行音乐的转折点，他们结合了饶舌摇滚以及高科技舞曲。Hip Hop二人组, 例如Deux在1990年早期亦渐渐受欢迎。\n\n韩流的诞生\n最早可追溯至韩国SM Entertainment由李秀满在1996年推出H.O.T 。随后YG Entertainment 由杨贤硕在1996年推出的“Keep Six”和DSP Media在1997年推出的“Sechs Kies”与JYP Entertainment则由朴振英在1999年推出“G.o.d.”，开始了韩国走向现今风靡全球的偶像组合模式。\n部分韩国歌唱组合，包括Roo`Ra、酷龙、IDOL、Sechs Kies、NRG、太四子、S.E.S.、Fin.K.L、Click-B、Fly to the Sky、神话等，在二十世纪九十年代中期，成功进军大中华地区。另一方面，Hip Hop和R&B音乐亦在这段时间被引入韩国，组合包括Drunken Tiger因此而获得成功。\n\n2000s: 全球化影响\n波兰华沙韩国文化中心外举着韩-波两国国旗的波兰歌迷\nSuper Junior、少女时代、B.A.P、SHINee、EXO、东方神起、BoA、f(x)、SS501、BIGBANG、4minute、Secret (组合)、Wonder Girls、T-ara、Brown Eyed Girls、2AM、2PM、U-Kiss、IU、MBLAQ、BEAST、FT Island、CNBLUE、INFINITE、TEEN TOP、ZE:A、B1A4、Boyfriend、金钟国、Leessang、A Pink等许多在韩国成功的组合或歌手开始进军日本市场，开始在日本接受访问或作表演、甚至固定演出日本综艺及出演电视剧等。\n2011年，K-Pop已经成为在东亚和东南亚一支主流音乐。有鉴及此，许多韩国经纪公司已经开始计划把K-Pop传播至全世界。而于2012年透过网络视频网站Youtube爆红的江南style则把K-Pop热潮推至新的高峰。该歌曲在欧美主流乐坛引起震动，于欧美多国流行音乐排行榜位列第一，而且引起了全球性的模仿热潮。同时籍此机会，使韩国的文化娱乐服务产业收支在历史上首次实现顺差。\n虽然K-Pop在非亚洲市场已经扎根，成为一支主流音乐，但大部分只在美国 、加拿大，以及澳洲。2001年，Nicholas Kim以单曲\"Hello Goodbye Hello\"，成为第一个打入美国告示牌百强单曲榜的韩国人。2009年，其中一队在韩国取得极大成功的组合Wonder Girls亦成功打入此榜。她们亦成为Jonas Brothers巡回演唱会的暖场嘉宾。其他韩国艺人亦曾与Kanye West、Teddy Riley、Diplo、Rodney Jerkins、Ludacris，以及Will.i.am等艺人合作。\n\nK-pop은 대한민국에서 대중적 인기를 얻는 유행 음악을 총칭한 이름이다. 간단히 가요, 또는 유행가라고 부르기도 하며, 영미권의 대중음악을 팝(pop)이라고 부르고, 영미권 이외의 국가의 대중가요도 국가 이니셜을 붙여 나타내는 데서(일본:J-pop 중국:C-pop) K-pop이라고 쓴다. 특히 대한민국 대중가요가 해외에서 인기를 얻게 된 이후에 K-pop이라는 명칭이 대한민국 이외 국가에서 대한민국 대중가요를 가리키는 이름으로 널리 자리잡고 있다. 반면 조선민주주의인민공화국의 대중가요는 NK-pop이라고 불리고 있으며 버스터미널 출발 배경음악은 유스퀘어나 센트럴시티 삽입곡 이며, 금호고속 광주↔서울 간 우등,일반고속버스 운행을 시작했으며. 도착지는 센트럴시티나 유스퀘어에 도착한다.","songs":[{"id":"xLDoC898167","name":"I","artist":"bgNIbd42d"},{"id":"mSuuis605b7","name":"Ko Ko Bop","artist":"3NLX3976e"},{"id":"xLyn9Wbc9be","name":"Missing

Jackson（迈克尔·杰克逊），Madonna（麦当娜），Janet Jackson(珍妮特·杰克逊)，Kylie Minogue(凯莉·米洛)，Christina Aguilera(克里斯蒂娜·阿奎莱拉)，Britney Spears(小甜甜布兰妮)，Beyoncé(碧昂丝)，Lady Gaga，ももいろクローバーZ(桃色幸运草),蔡依林，萧亚轩等。\n\nDance-pop is dance-oriented pop music that originated in the early 1980s. Developing from post-disco and synthpop, it is generally up-tempo music intended for clubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Dance-pop music is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions. \n\nDance-pop is a popular style and there are several artists and groups who perform in the genre. Notable ones include Justin Timberlake, Corina, Britney Spears, Usher, Jennifer Lopez, Celine Dion, Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Rick Astley, Sheena Easton, Mel & Kim, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Lady Gaga, George Michael, Bananarama, Spice Girls, Christina Aguilera, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Kesha, Backstreet Boys, and among others.","songs":[{"id":"xLBh2qb7262","name":"Panama","artist":"xALQijb08b9"},{"id":"8GzKGCf96ac","name":"Love Yourself","artist":"bgZGd035c"},{"id":"mQG2VI687ed","name":"Roar","artist":"6nS89849"},{"id":"mQ9Q2J5de1d","name":"Call Me Maybe","artist":"E2P77875"},{"id":"mQ8V8Z89b73","name":"Moves Like Jagger","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"xL1vpH9ece3","name":"으르렁 (Growl)","artist":"3NLX3976e"},{"id":"mQLUGM94ba1","name":"Bang Bang","artist":"LBv5a141"},{"id":"mQJZNy78eba","name":"Problem","artist":"eDey95359"},{"id":"8HQAfseb754","name":"Havana","artist":"bQmqjg911d1"},{"id":"mQQ01W6a840","name":"PARTY","artist":"jCEfd436"},{"id":"bCmKbEv6eed1","name":"Bad Boy","artist":"b7lGXVeb5ad"},{"id":"M1xi6460d","name":"Apologize","artist":"6kd4f392"}],"albums":[{"id":"xScNdTb1cb1","name":"XOXO (Kiss & Hug) [Repackage]","artist":"3NLX3976e"},{"id":"pzeWAc8259","name":"LOVE ME RIGHT [Repackage]","artist":"3NLX3976e"},{"id":"bC6XhGy49adb","name":"Purpose","artist":"bgZGd035c"},{"id":"spyqQac875","name":"XOXO (Kiss ＆ Hug)","artist":"3NLX3976e"},{"id":"cSoXqF9b27b","name":"Panama","artist":"xALQijb08b9"},{"id":"cAMNBYc6585","name":"PRISM","artist":"6nS89849"},{"id":"bK9eL78737a","name":"My Everything","artist":"bm3mb9d22"},{"id":"yhUJeCa9174","name":"DON’T MESS UP MY TEMPO – The 5...","artist":"3NLX3976e"},{"id":"nmThkT948c3","name":"Lion Heart","artist":"jCEfd436"},{"id":"mjdrG380741","name":"EXODUS","artist":"3NLX3976e"},{"id":"3ji8c102","name":"爱你","artist":"ixyea99c"},{"id":"geDud65e4","name":"Moves Like Jagger","artist":"bwkd183b2"}],"artists":[{"id":"3NLX3976e","name":"EXO"},{"id":"bwkd183b2","name":"Maroon 5"},{"id":"jCEfd436","name":"少女时代"},{"id":"f80a12c8","name":"蔡依林"},{"id":"bwpP2dfec","name":"Rihanna"},{"id":"cs5P2d05d","name":"Lady Gaga"},{"id":"3c862f8e","name":"Michael Jackson"},{"id":"E2P77875","name":"Carly Rae Jepsen"},{"id":"6nS89849","name":"Katy Perry"},{"id":"nBs2913b","name":"萧亚轩"},{"id":"bgZGd035c","name":"Justin Bieber"},{"id":"cZgZ37e11","name":"Mariah Carey"}]},{"type":"style","id":"989","name":"梦幻流行 Dream Pop","description":"Dream Pop，顾名思义，就是「如梦般的流行曲」。Dream Pop是八十年代中期于英伦兴起的一种Pop Music，它除了着重动听的旋律之外，也十分注重营造一种飘渺的氛围，乐手努力用Synthesizers（电子合成器）及电结他去炮制一种迷糊的音响质感，音乐部份大多有层层叠加的感觉，而歌者的歌声往往加上了回音，加强那种虚幻感觉，歌词也常常写得抽象而充满诗意。当你觉得世界一团糟糕，一片浑浊，正需要音乐来麻醉与过滤，Dream Pop那虚无与纯粹的声音，可以让心情再次变回蓝色。\n\n在中国，也有具有该风格的艺人。王菲在98年的《唱游》中就做了大量的气声化处理，营造出一种梦幻飘渺的境界，这和王菲欣赏Cocteau Twins并与其在96年的《浮躁》中的合作是密不可分的，而《唱游》也获得了世界十佳Dream Pop专辑。\n\nDream Pop is a genre characterized by an overall subdued atmosphere - from the vocals to the melodies - producing a dream-like, sleepy, or spacious feel. As the name suggests, songs are structured around traditionally Pop-sounding progressions, often with a steady though de-emphasized beat and vocals that are lower in the mix and possibly run through effects so as to offer a more ethereal feel. \n\nBand structures are usually pretty straightforward sporting a guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. Vocals are a distinguishing element of Dream Pop and can often be viewed predominantly as an instrument, with importance being placed moreso on providing melody and less on the actual lyrics. In addition, it is not uncommon for there to be more than one vocalist, either working in unison or switching off. Females have a very prominent role in this genre in this respect, with acts such as My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, and Mazzy Star - among others - having female vocalists. \n\nIt is also not uncommon for Dream Pop to be fused with other genres like Shoegaze or Noise Pop. The main distinguishing factors though are that while they all offer a similar, \"blanketing\" feel, Dream Pop does not rely on \"walls of sound\" (as in Shoegaze) or heavily distorted, very driving guitars (as in Noise Pop).","songs":[{"id":"bqvbMEw38ea4","name":"Intro","artist":"ecUI723af"},{"id":"xLETbcc5b31","name":"Youth","artist":"biy6aff4c"},{"id":"mQJUj07588f","name":"West Coast","artist":"dv4Y34ea9"},{"id":"b38cVd113b","name":"You and Your Sister","artist":"bt10fe002"},{"id":"b4HNHd0edb","name":"Safe And Sound","artist":"6kJfa1a5"},{"id":"mQ7QWs872d4","name":"2 Wicky","artist":"TBsa49d8"},{"id":"xLpYaEb570f","name":"If","artist":"FQE4e879"},{"id":"xLusKWd5b70","name":"Midnight City","artist":"Wnlacbab"},{"id":"dCyn62a7cd","name":"Flowers in December","artist":"bt0xefd3a"},{"id":"mQIBD95e71e","name":"Magic","artist":"6e095c23"},{"id":"b30wuc54af","name":"Black Acres","artist":"cZ3g37b0c"}],"albums":[{"id":"9aRl4109a","name":"xx","artist":"ecUI723af"},{"id":"k1IBa8e17","name":"Born to Die","artist":"dv4Y34ea9"},{"id":"nmHL5K5282b","name":"Ultraviolence","artist":"dv4Y34ea9"},{"id":"1fAH4aa79","name":"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming","artist":"Wnlacbab"},{"id":"bC6WXnM451a3","name":"Honeymoon","artist":"dv4Y34ea9"},{"id":"nnd48F557bc","name":"I See You (Deluxe)","artist":"ecUI723af"},{"id":"sBDC21a0e","name":"Island","artist":"FQE4e879"},{"id":"jgzXa6882","name":"Azure Ray","artist":"6kJfa1a5"},{"id":"bqHFPrD364e8","name":"占梦仪式","artist":"bC7DehZ44f90"},{"id":"iPr0c4ac9","name":"Blood","artist":"bt10fe002"},{"id":"oxiGe2432","name":"Singles 96-06","artist":"TBsa49d8"},{"id":"eUup5935b","name":"Burn and Shiver","artist":"6kJfa1a5"}],"artists":[{"id":"dv4Y34ea9","name":"Lana Del Rey"},{"id":"biy6aff4c","name":"Troye Sivan"},{"id":"3xzc5875","name":"The Cranberries"},{"id":"ecUI723af","name":"The xx"},{"id":"O5z58afe","name":"Aimer"},{"id":"33w60621","name":"Sigur Rós"},{"id":"ueW3af83","name":"刺猬"},{"id":"yhDtnyaa125","name":"Cigarettes After Sex"},{"id":"FQE4e879","name":"丁可"},{"id":"bt0xefd3a","name":"Mazzy Star"},{"id":"SEQ9f641","name":"Cocteau Twins"},{"id":"bMhb2144c","name":"Devics"}]},{"type":"style","id":"343","name":"成人时代 Adult Contemporary","description":"成人时代（Adult Contemporary，简称AC）如字面所说，主要面向成年的成熟的听众。它整体上延续了六七十年代的轻音乐、轻摇滚乐风，也受到灵魂、R&B、摇滚等风格的不同程度的影响，同时顺应时代适度融合流行/摇滚潮流。重抒情，特别是爱情。浪漫的、细腻的乃至是些许伤感的主题，和成人时代的舒缓氛围、动听旋律、优美和声搭配绝佳。旋律上漂亮得足够吸引人，然而又漂亮得很成人风范，谦逊稳重，不争夺注意力，也非常适合用作背景音乐。在AC电台，经典歌曲通常更受欢迎。多年来成人时代涌现了一批优秀的音乐家，包括Elton John, Billy Joel, Air Supply, Michael Bolton, Phil Cillins, Lionel Richie, Chicago, Celine Dion。\n\nAdult contemporary music (AC) is a style of music, ranging from 1960s vocal and 1970s soft rock music to predominantly ballad-heavy music of the present day, with varying degrees of easy listening, soul, rhythm and blues, and rock influence. Adult contemporary is rather a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of pop/rock music.&nbsp;\nAdult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on melody and harmonies is accentuated. It is usually melodic enough to get a listener's attention, and is inoffensive and pleasurable enough to work well as background music. Like most of pop music, its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a verse-chorus structure.\nAdult contemporary is heavy on romantic ballads which mostly use acoustic instruments (though bass guitar is usually used) such as acoustic guitars, pianos, saxophones, and sometimes an orchestral set. The electric guitars are normally faint and high-pitched. However, recent adult contemporary music may usually feature synthesizers (and other electronics, such as drum machines).\nAC radio may play mainstream music, but they will exclude hip hop, dance tracks, hard rock and some forms of teen pop, as they are less popular amongst the target demographic of these radio stations, which is intended for an adult audience. The AC Radio stations will often target the 25–44 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s. Many adult contemporary stations play less newer music because they also give ample airtime to hits of the past, so the de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart.\nOver the years, AC has spawned numerous sub-genres: \"hot AC\", \"soft AC\" (also known as \"lite AC\"), \"urban AC\", \"rhythmic AC\", and \"Christian AC\" (i.e., a softer type of Contemporary Christian music). Some radio stations play only \"hot AC\", \"soft AC\", or only one of the variety of sub-genres. Therefore, it is not usually considered a specific genre of music; it is merely an assemblage of selected tracks from musicians of many different genres.","songs":[{"id":"mQSGYc6ff91","name":"Hello","artist":"dSoV491e5"},{"id":"cQCLB21af2","name":"Because Of You","artist":"bwmF17b77"},{"id":"TTtU54f0d","name":"Cry on My

Indie Pop","description":"Indie Pop起源于20世纪80年代初期的英国。你可以把Indie Pop看作是一种更有旋律、更少吵杂以及更少焦虑的Indie Rock类型，它所折射的是地下音乐柔和、唯美的一面。Indie Pop的音乐更着重于声音的融洽、音乐的编排以及歌词的创作。在从Chamber Pop华美的管弦乐编曲到Twee Pop的简单直率中，Indie Pop所包含的一切，其焦点或者说这种音乐的侧重点一如都是歌曲多于声响。\n\n尽管Indie Pop和Indie Rock都信奉朋克的D.I.Y（Do It Yourself）精神，但是前者反对朋克的虚无主义态度以及音乐上的声音碾磨处理。\n\n注：独立流行乐可以是一个宽泛的概念，它可以囊括一大堆具有分明特点的有着独立流行气质的音乐，比如Chamber Pop、Dream Pop、Twee Pop&C86等等，但是由于这些音乐都有着各自的特别气质，所以它们又都自成一派，因此也就有相对应的音乐风格术语来更加确切地描述它们。那么从另一个角度来看，那些不足以形成一派的独立流行乐将会呈现出一种多样化的音乐气质，此时，我们可以把这些理解为狭义上的独立流行乐。注意，即使是狭义上的独立流行乐，藉着音乐自身的多变性以及融合性，它也不可以被一种表达所能具体地确切描述。\n\nIndie pop is a genre of alternative rock music that originated in the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s, with its roots in Scottish post-punk bands on the Postcard Records label in the early '80s (Josef K and Orange Juice) and the dominant UK independent band of the mid-'80s, The Smiths. Indie pop was inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free.\nThe term \"indie\" had been used for some time to describe artists on independent labels (and the labels themselves), but the key moment in the naming of \"indie pop\" as a genre was the release of NME's C86 tape in 1986. The compilation featured, among other artists, Primal Scream, The Pastels, and The Wedding Present, and \"indie\" quickly became shorthand for a genre whose defining conventions were identified as jangling guitars, a love of '60s pop, and melodic power pop song structures (the genre was initially dubbed \"C86\" after the tape itself).\n\nIn the mid to late '80s, indie pop was criticized for its associations with so-called \"shambling\" (a John Peel-coined description celebrating the self-conscious primitive approach of some of the music) and underachievement, but the C86 indie pop scene is now recognized as a pivotal moment for independent music in the UK, as is recognized in the subtitle of that compilation's 2006 extended reissue: CD86: 48 Tracks from the Birth of Indie Pop. Indie pop continues to have a strong following and inspire musicians, not just in the UK but around the world, with new bands, labels and clubs devoted to the sound.","songs":[{"id":"8GsFwX1a7f8","name":"南山南","artist":"bDHDf17a3"},{"id":"xL2kAOd6081","name":"房间","artist":"bfDOgUW32e02"},{"id":"xLDMDIcc5c1","name":"春风十里","artist":"nmSu3A90eaf"},{"id":"b6ochace3f","name":"Almost Lover","artist":"89u83382"},{"id":"bqvbMEw38ea4","name":"Intro","artist":"ecUI723af"},{"id":"8Ghhb4eb8fb","name":"Demons","artist":"NhF6f9e0"},{"id":"OK6b60562","name":"Say Hello","artist":"Wfrdad86"},{"id":"OEaL70399","name":"Gotta Have You","artist":"WfQ16428"},{"id":"xLwlGya3687","name":"Let Her Go","artist":"XeBa04d3"},{"id":"U5B12Q2ac61","name":"Somebody That I Used To Know","artist":"bDrFeac50"},{"id":"mQFneH894ab","name":"Royals","artist":"jbuDqp64e9d"},{"id":"mQ3QG58b484","name":"Everybody","artist":"YR7baf56"}],"albums":[{"id":"9czsfWf7b29","name":"所有的酒，都不如你","artist":"nmSu3A90eaf"},{"id":"JfNDsi1ef23","name":"孤岛","artist":"bDHDf17a3"},{"id":"d3uTTgf2f4f","name":"私房歌","artist":"bfDOgUW32e02"},{"id":"9aRl4109a","name":"xx","artist":"ecUI723af"},{"id":"n1Xvfdff9","name":"One Cell In the Sea","artist":"89u83382"},{"id":"mfBpCv78635","name":"Pure Heroine","artist":"jbuDqp64e9d"},{"id":"gqWf8ba0f","name":"Continued Silence","artist":"NhF6f9e0"},{"id":"k7uKbe548","name":"预谋邂逅","artist":"iOVJca2d1"},{"id":"eUrN50be3","name":"These Friends of Mine","artist":"bwmX19f55"},{"id":"mbUOq590be1","name":"自在","artist":"hdUce5e6"},{"id":"nsfSee059","name":"Say I Am You","artist":"WfQ16428"},{"id":"nSXM1d1d6","name":"A Little Love","artist":"beI09dc69"}],"artists":[{"id":"dy27de04","name":"苏打绿"},{"id":"hdJ15ee6","name":"安溥"},{"id":"eaMJ70b1e","name":"逃跑计划"},{"id":"CTI60914","name":"Lenka"},{"id":"dv4Y34ea9","name":"Lana Del Rey"},{"id":"ijL1970a","name":"曹方"},{"id":"NhF6f9e0","name":"Imagine Dragons"},{"id":"9dfmeTebec7","name":"陈雪凝"},{"id":"Wfabeb9e","name":"Keren Ann"},{"id":"cKig2d251","name":"Sia"},{"id":"dpIrSpbcfdb","name":"窦靖童"},{"id":"btJO1bbc0","name":"Damien Rice"}]},{"type":"style","id":"2986","name":"男孩团体 Boy Band","description":"Boy Band顾名思义是由几位男生组成的乐队。在90年代早期到新世纪中期的欧美乐坛中Boy Band一直是最受欢迎的模式，也出过不少组合。\n\n代表组合有BACKSTREET BOYS、NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK、BLUE、BOYZONE、WESTLIFE等组合,由于经济人的包装使得90年代后期boyband式的组合在欧美乐坛中不断涌现,所唱歌曲也形成了具有较统一风格的Boy Band式曲风,是20纪末较有影响力的一类曲风。\n\nA boy band (or boyband) is loosely defined as a vocal group consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation. Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term somewhat of a misnomer. However, exceptions do exist. Most boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.\nSome such bands form on their own. They can evolve out of church choral or gospel music groups, but are often created by talent managers or record producers who hold auditions. Due to this and their general commercial orientation towards a female audience of preteens, teenyboppers, or teens, the term may be used with negative connotations in music journalism. Boy bands are similar in concept to their counterparts, girl groups.","songs":[{"id":"C5R14483d","name":"那就这样吧","artist":"dtg9426c"},{"id":"b1qjRZn66122","name":"大梦想家","artist":"fEpnXN272b1"},{"id":"onwweef20","name":"只对你有感觉","artist":"heq134d1"},{"id":"eWl84baf2","name":"失恋阵线联盟","artist":"dsz63228"},{"id":"xLugy9b692b","name":"Glad You Came","artist":"Kl3540ff"},{"id":"xLvbHpdc6be","name":"What Makes You Beautiful","artist":"cc3A1ecc1"},{"id":"8Gaoe5eeac5","name":"My Love","artist":"cZYi3abc5"},{"id":"b0hFV9d08b","name":"As Long as You Love Me","artist":"bsEsfa74d"},{"id":"mTaJrI63e06","name":"Tempo","artist":"3NLX3976e"},{"id":"ckDEiee735","name":"U Make Me Wanna","artist":"Wj69d39e"},{"id":"jYMqa8e2f","name":"掌心","artist":"dzy59c6f"},{"id":"jiZPd105b","name":"流星雨","artist":"lhk32972"}],"albums":[{"id":"TNEdb328","name":"百万全纪录","artist":"dtg9426c"},{"id":"nmTjk04ca74","name":"大梦想家","artist":"fEpnXN272b1"},{"id":"yhUJeCa9174","name":"DON’T MESS UP MY TEMPO – The 5...","artist":"3NLX3976e"},{"id":"bfQlS6ae4a","name":"青春修炼手册","artist":"fEpnXN272b1"},{"id":"84957d94","name":"飞轮海","artist":"heq134d1"},{"id":"byB5f8b0d","name":"双面飞轮海","artist":"heq134d1"},{"id":"ws2d29906","name":"越来越爱","artist":"heq134d1"},{"id":"jgrO11800","name":"One Love","artist":"Wj69d39e"},{"id":"krU5bdae2","name":"Glad You Came","artist":"Kl3540ff"},{"id":"3Keba554","name":"失恋阵线联盟","artist":"dsz63228"},{"id":"8gAt40f9b","name":"Coast to Coast","artist":"cZYi3abc5"},{"id":"o52Hf6603","name":"What Makes You Beautiful","artist":"cc3A1ecc1"}],"artists":[{"id":"3NLX3976e","name":"EXO"},{"id":"fEpnXN272b1","name":"TFBOYS"},{"id":"cZYi3abc5","name":"Westlife"},{"id":"h4WRv633520","name":"防弹少年团"},{"id":"bsEsfa74d","name":"Backstreet Boys"},{"id":"bXU9Dd88b13","name":"EXO-M"},{"id":"cc3A1ecc1","name":"One Direction"},{"id":"mFixoh58361","name":"EXO-K"},{"id":"yhD3Abda5b5","name":"NCT 127"},{"id":"myGle56f38","name":"WINNER"},{"id":"heq134d1","name":"飞轮海"},{"id":"Wj69d39e","name":"Blue"}]},{"type":"style","id":"310","name":"女子团体 Girl Group","description":"起源于上世纪50年代的Girl Group通常是由三人或更多的女性成员组成的流行组合，风格上包括节奏布鲁斯、摇滚和传统流行等。这类形式的团体基本会有一个女主唱来配合背景和声。\n\nA girl group is a popular music act featuring several young female singers who generally harmonise together.\nGirl groups emerged in the late 1950s as groups of young singers teamed up with behind-the-scenes songwriters and music producers to create hit singles, often featuring glossy production values and backing by top studio musicians.

It contrasts with cantata, which is accompanied singing. A cappella was originally intended to differentiate between Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato style. In the 19th century a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.","songs":[{"id":"UU4P68596","name":"Deutschland","artist":"b5tJf0423"},{"id":"xL7fbx157d5","name":"Rather

Taiwan Folk Scene","description":"台湾民歌运动，也称校园民歌。在1970年代之前，台湾年轻人喜爱的音乐主流为西洋音乐。1972年，当时美国总统尼克松访问中华人民共和国，触发了部分“用自己的语言，创作自己的歌曲”的想法，并喊出“唱自己的歌”的口号。1970年代今是有限公司与歌林公司音乐出版部合作制播音乐节目《金曲奖》，由中国电视公司播出，主旨是鼓励优良歌曲创作；1981年至1983 年，天鼎传播公司制播歌词歌曲创作比赛节目《大学城》，由台湾电视公司播出；这两个节目带动了台湾的校园民歌风潮。\n\n1975年，杨弦和胡德夫在台北市中山堂演唱以余光中的《乡愁四韵》等现代诗谱曲的作品，被视为是台湾现代民歌发展的开始。1976年，在淡江大学的一场民歌演唱会上，李双泽在台上抛掉可乐瓶，拿起吉他开始唱起了自己的歌，改写自蒋勋的“少年中国”，于是揭开校园民歌序幕的变点，也正式在全国校园里袭卷起一片民歌运动。当时著名的民歌手尚有陈明韶、包美圣、黄大城、赵树海、李建复、齐豫、叶佳修、王海玲、王梦麟、苏来与杨祖珺等人。《龙的传人》是台湾校园民歌的代表性作品，作者为侯德健，首唱者为李建复。\n\n除了校园演唱之外，广播人陶晓清也是台湾民歌发展的重要推手。她开放自己的节目，让年轻的音乐创作者有一个发表的平台。1977年，陶女士邀请朱介英、吴统雄、吴楚楚、杨祖珺、韩正皓、胡德夫、陈屏、杨弦等八位民歌手灌录了唱片《我们的歌》，大大带动了校园民歌风潮。 之后，新格唱片推出金韵奖，海山唱片创办民谣风；这两项民歌创作比赛，将民歌带向商业化。这些在民歌奖项中脱颖而出的创作者，此外电视歌唱比赛节目如五灯奖、六灯奖也推波助澜的作用，为以后的台湾唱片市场打下基础。\n\n民歌运动早期歌咏山水、青春，旋律清新自然、歌词朴素，并有浓厚的中国风和各大学及大专院校校园气味，包括中国景物怀咏、古典文学意识等等。早期有李双泽、叶佳修、苏来、李建复、刘蓝溪、邰肇玫、包美圣、施碧梧、齐豫、陈明韶、赵树海等歌手，后期的、潘越云、郑怡、林佳蓉、黄韵玲、许景淳、施孝荣、王梦麟、银霞、王海玲、木吉他合唱团等。\n作曲作词者则有靳铁章、毕心一、毕奂一、林建助、许翰君、陈云山、黄大城、王新莲、吴楚楚等民歌主力。\n\n1970年代后期，台湾社会运动风起云涌，人心鼓动，在侯德建、罗大佑、李泰祥的介入，民歌运动有了质的跃进，与初期的淳朴无瑕多了人文关怀和社会责任。此时大量的歌词是知名作家的诗作，如三毛、余光中、席慕容 、蒋勋等人的作品，而随着侯德建、罗大佑、李泰祥、李寿全的作品的流传，民歌运动达到前所未有的高度。\n\n历史上台湾民歌主题根据分析，可以分为以下几类：\n\n怀古与历史\n龙的传人（李建复演唱）、唐山子民（黄大城演唱）、中华之爱（施孝荣演唱）、易水寒（施孝荣演唱）、古国今昔（王梦麟演唱）、侠客（施孝荣演唱）、我心似清泉（王海玲演唱）、送你一把泥土（费玉清演唱）、赤壁赋（施孝荣演唱，陈云山词）\n\n乡愁\n乡愁四韵（余光中作品）、归去来兮（侯德建作品，李建复演唱）、归人沙城（施孝荣演唱）、出塞曲（蔡琴演唱）、芦歌（李建复演唱）\n\n中国诗词（含新诗）\n钗头凤（包美圣演唱，宋陆游词）、雨霖铃（包美圣演唱，宋朝柳永词）、秘摩崖月夜（包美圣演唱，胡适新诗）、雪花的快乐（王海玲演唱，徐志摩新诗）、再别康桥（范广惠演唱，徐志摩新诗）、浮生千山路（潘越云演唱，陈幸蕙集诗词）、歌(罗大佑演唱，徐志摩译自英国女诗人

Pop的旋律飘忽于涡旋吉他所营造的声场中时，其音乐经常会给人一种朦胧、麻醉和催眠的感觉，当然Noise Pop可以是欢快活泼的，也可以是棱角分明、富有挑战性的。\n\n最早期的Noise Pop植根于the Velvet Underground的诸如回馈、失真等音乐实验，然而更被公众认同的Noise Pop起源乐队是美国另类摇滚乐队Sonic Youth和Dinosaur Jr.，是他们将摇滚乐构架与粗重的吉他失真融合在了一起。第一支正规意义上的Noise Pop乐队则是the Jesus & Mary Chain，它以1986年的首张唱片Psychocandy崛起于地下，几乎同一时期还诞生了可以说是最多产和最具生命力的Noise Pop乐队Yo La Tengo，其首张专辑也于此时推出。\n\n在80年代末，Noise Pop引发了英伦的Shoegazing（自赏）运动，自赏音乐更加内省，其旋律更加脆弱。在90年代，Noise Pop仍继续对Indie Rock产生着重要的影响。\n\nNoise Pop is a vague term used to describe a wide range of bands who use the feedback and distortion of Noise in a Pop context. \n\nAlthough the two often overlap each other, Noise Pop is generally considered more accessible than Noise Rock. The genre commonly features more melodic singing and vocal-based harmonies. In keeping with the loose theme of accessibilty, the structures and presentation of the songs are often less experimental. \nThe genre came into its own in the mid-80s following the Post-Punk boom, with bands like The Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, Pixies, and Pavement defining its sound.","songs":[{"id":"eW1SU36c0d","name":"Lust","artist":"6pb89a8b"},{"id":"xLs4Sgc6a22","name":"Shook Down","artist":"blWNad679"},{"id":"cWYvm36f76","name":"My

Pop是80年代中期的一次美国后朋克音乐运动，它的主要标志是其音乐上回归于60年代的和谐吉他和流行旋律。R.E.M.的到来所激起的瞬间火花使得Jangle Pop也具有民谣摇滚的色彩，但是从根本上说它仍是一种基于流行乐的音乐类型。Jangle Pop不是主流音乐－--乐队的歌词经常是故意地含糊其意、声响未经润色和具非职业性的特点，也就是说这种音乐具有do-it-yourself精神下的所有特点。\n\nJangle pop在1984至1987年间成为一支主要音乐力量－不仅是因为有着如R.E.M.和Let's Active这样的南方流行乐队、也不仅是因为有着西海岸颇具迷幻风格的Paisley Underground运动中的诸多乐队，而且还因为有着遍布中西部的大量乐队。80年代末，这种声音不再受到欢迎，主要也是因为人们听到了太多的没有各自特色的类似音乐。尽管R.E.M.努力过渡到主流－事实上，这支乐队成为了世界上最流行的乐队－其它很多的乐队（包括Uncle Green和Miracle Legion）在90年代早期如同人间蒸发般的消失解散。\n\nJangle Pop is a Rock music sub-genre with roots in the Post-Punk explosion of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Influenced by 1960s Folk Rock artists like The Byrds as well as the Power Pop of groups like Big Star, Jangle Pop is characterized for merging the sound of chiming, \"jangly\" guitars and Pop-oriented melodies with a somewhat rawer musical approach and production values. The genre found its greatest critical and mainstream popularity in the mid-1980s, with bands like The Smiths, R.E.M. and Felt.\n\nThe Californian Paisley Underground movement, which emerged during the mid-1980s, is considered a derivation of this style, while also incorporating Psychedelic Rock influences.","songs":[{"id":"mQ6vKy53ba0","name":"Open Up Your Heart And Let The Sun Shine In","artist":"6lO6a441"},{"id":"UaY96ae78","name":"Made of Stone","artist":"2M495973"},{"id":"xLB6QQdb70f","name":"Another One","artist":"iQ3sd7a87"},{"id":"mQLYBi70901","name":"June","artist":"ddY24Lc741d"},{"id":"KRGK7a4b1","name":"'74-'75","artist":"Tync47d2"},{"id":"eOli235e46","name":"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out","artist":"2LR90f0b"},{"id":"xLsILmdc5fb","name":"Adversity","artist":"bj3ue0746"},{"id":"xNHFXed390f","name":"Intro","artist":"UwyVWX2688b"},{"id":"8HSy7Aec662","name":"Sweet Dew Lee","artist":"bsEA1d7e6"},{"id":"Led88ca00","name":"Tomorrow Never Comes","artist":"TyZca982"},{"id":"8Gdiipe6adc","name":"Heart In Your Heartbreak","artist":"beSmdddfb"},{"id":"b1n3Ra84a7","name":"The One I Love","artist":"2JI7a312"}],"albums":[{"id":"FcY8b9a1","name":"The Stone Roses","artist":"2M495973"},{"id":"cgB18H6abb0","name":"Another One","artist":"iQ3sd7a87"},{"id":"hDkIkd2d91c","name":"Salad Days","artist":"iQ3sd7a87"},{"id":"xjmZctd7b49","name":"Horsebeach","artist":"ddY24Lc741d"},{"id":"beWqb6a14","name":"The Queen Is Dead","artist":"2LR90f0b"},{"id":"nndHRc4ccfb","name":"Somersault","artist":"bj3ue0746"},{"id":"kkwoa58d6","name":"What a Pleasure","artist":"bj3ue0746"},{"id":"eCEh79333","name":"Ring","artist":"Tync47d2"},{"id":"bTe0Wf83b71","name":"Is the Is Are","artist":"ndqbf533a"},{"id":"bC7h6oW44d4a","name":"Beauty & Sadness","artist":"ddY24Lc741d"},{"id":"nSDXe6a73","name":"The Sound Of The Smiths","artist":"2LR90f0b"},{"id":"yhPyoTc2924","name":"How to Solve Our Human Problem...","artist":"bsEA1d7e6"}],"artists":[{"id":"2LR90f0b","name":"The Smiths"},{"id":"2JI7a312","name":"R.E.M."},{"id":"2M495973","name":"The Stone Roses"},{"id":"m23Crb61515","name":"Gatsby in a Daze"},{"id":"bj3ue0746","name":"Beach Fossils"},{"id":"iQ3sd7a87","name":"Mac DeMarco"},{"id":"cP7u2ef05","name":"Wild Nothing"},{"id":"beSmdddfb","name":"The Pains of Being Pure at Heart"},{"id":"dUJd44d91","name":"Кино"},{"id":"bsJYe5813","name":"Morrissey"},{"id":"dqB238a7c","name":"Motorama"},{"id":"da5Q380f3","name":"Felt"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3017","name":"前卫流行 Progressive Pop","description":"Progressive Pop是前卫摇滚和流行乐之间衔接的桥梁。简而言之，将前卫摇滚的复杂音乐编排及结构与流行乐中简明易变通的旋律相结合，创造出一种有别于两者的音乐。\n\nProgressive pop is a genre that bridges the musical elements of Progressive Rock and Pop to bring them together. In short, the complexity of arrangements and musical structure found in the former are combined with the catchiness, oftentimes simple melodies, and accessibility of the latter, to bring a sound distinct from both. Long song times (relative to most pop music) and changing themes are also a common feature. \nEarly influences and examples of progressive pop can be seen in The Beach Boys' \"Heroes and Villains\" and The Moody Blues' In Search of the Lost Chord. The 1970s see the appearance of Pop/Rock influenced artists such as The Alan Parsons Project and Supertramp (Breakfast in America being a prime example in particular).

Used at first in an almost derogatory fashion, the word \"twee\", meaning overly quaint or cute, was applied by commentators who saw a \"revolt into childhood\" demonstrated by its practitioners. Musically, it can be characterized by jangling guitars with a distinct Post-Punk background and 60s Pop influence, similarly with other Indie Pop acts, but also with a more noticeable theme of innocent and amorous subject matter. UK label Sarah Records and US label K Records have exerted the most influence upon the genre. Notable bands include Beat Happening, The Field Mice, Tiger Trap, Heavenly, and Belle and Sebastian.","songs":[{"id":"ckAYgf8018","name":"Love In

Chamber Pop","description":"Chamber Pop是指典雅、高贵、精致的一种流行乐，它有一定的古典音乐感觉。Chamber Pop一词来自古典音乐，中文叫\"室内乐\"，是种小组弦乐演奏曲式，气氛高雅。Chamber Pop于九十年代兴起，是对当时的LO-FI及GRUNGE的一种反应，强调优美的旋律、精致的配乐、干净的录音，每每多用弦乐、管乐制造巴洛克时代的音乐感觉。外国代表乐队有THE DIVINE COMEDY，RIALTO，ERIC MATTHEWS及BALLE & SEBASTIAN等，香港则有黄耀明、部分的彭羚、部分的MULTIPLEX等等。\n\nChamber Pop的崛起很大程度上是对1990年代另类音乐群落中的Lo-Fi美学的统治地位所作的回应，它从包括Brian Wilson、Burt Bacharach以及Lee Hazlewood的豪华管弦乐演奏作品中吸取养分。Chamber Pop部分灵感来自于驰放音乐，但是完全没有讽刺和庸俗在里面，它给予音乐的旋律和创作以一种全新的关注，如巴洛克风格的音乐层次、有着丰富质地的管弦和号角的华丽歌曲。Chamber Pop实际上是一直否认Grunge、Electronica和其它同时期的音乐运动的存在。\n\n注：可以说室内流行乐是独立流行乐中极其讲求编曲和旋律的一支。在它的音乐中，艺人的编曲创作经常会用到各种古典以及管弦器乐（如各种提琴、钢琴、萨克斯、小号等等），因此有的室内流行乐作品在音乐的编曲上，你可以体会它所具有的复杂性和层叠性，另外，由于其它一些音乐风格元素的引用（比如轻柔的电子元素）更加使得此种音乐的乐感十分地丰富；这种音乐的旋律的确有着一种高雅的气质，有时，甚至是人声都是具有古典或者美声唱腔的。\n\nChamber Pop is a term commonly used in reference to Indie Pop artists such as Antony and the Johnsons, Tindersticks, Migala and Belle and Sebastian, who are strongly influenced by the Baroque Pop artists of the 1960s.","songs":[{"id":"xLrMuRb0d37","name":"Riverside","artist":"bA9Xeca75"},{"id":"mQGvd889c00","name":"Take Me To Church","artist":"yfWNMrdc983"},{"id":"b4FaKa5a11","name":"Nine Million

On the iTunes Store, the genre is represented as part of the Christian and gospel genre.\n\nAlternative sub-genres such as Christian punk, Christian hardcore, Christian metal and Christian hip hop, although not normally considered CCM, can also come under the genre's umbrella. Contemporary worship music is also incorporated in modern CCM. Contemporary worship is both recorded and performed during church services.\n\nSeveral mainstream artists, such as The Byrds, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Elvis Presley, Creed, Lifehouse and U2, have dealt with Christian themes in their music, yet are not part of the CCM industry.","songs":[{"id":"b63l3c77c9","name":"Imagine Me Without You","artist":"bPcP1e7c3"},{"id":"mQ5ogPc3360","name":"There Is Love","artist":"b5co1d28f"},{"id":"mSQnMH8d033","name":"You Say","artist":"nafgab729cd"},{"id":"VmWU6be19","name":"Britney ","artist":"bQub1fa28"},{"id":"xLrjkrc1e6f","name":"Restless","artist":"egjQ49abf"}],"albums":[{"id":"ojYM2e321","name":"Somewhere Down The Road","artist":"buAGe9f87"},{"id":"nVoXe80a5","name":"Great God Who Saves","artist":"FkI8529f"},{"id":"jOZvd51cc","name":"The Lost Get Found","artist":"cuFK2c6f8"},{"id":"jXeu14fc3","name":"Just You and Me","artist":"eaAT4b38e"},{"id":"nni2nb6b404","name":"Look Up Child","artist":"nafgab729cd"},{"id":"w7vM26d3f","name":"That Was Then This Is Now","artist":"b5co1d28f"},{"id":"muEOka4ceea","name":"You Make Me Brave","artist":"nbPbeb1bc"},{"id":"x92Wdndde71","name":"Brave","artist":"bVWu24e93"},{"id":"fBSP83849","name":"Life Light Up","artist":"dCyE42888"},{"id":"ffr855a05","name":"Crystal Clear","artist":"bPcP1e7c3"},{"id":"jSmiba2f7","name":"Hello Hurricane","artist":"62z5a39f"},{"id":"jPM8ad824","name":"Take Me with You","artist":"GKC9b2bb"}],"artists":[{"id":"buAGe9f87","name":"Amy Grant"},{"id":"bPcP1e7c3","name":"Jaci Velasquez"},{"id":"nbPbeb1bc","name":"Bethel Music"},{"id":"nafgab729cd","name":"Lauren Daigle"},{"id":"3Bd5b91e","name":"Sixpence None the Richer"},{"id":"iOTgd8c9f","name":"소향"},{"id":"YcZba5e0","name":"Michael W.

The style largely developed in the '80s, following a revival of traditional Irish folk during the '70s which, over time, found performers with strong folk roots gradually beginning to mix elements of rock and pop into their original compositions (although predominantly rock artists like the Pogues don't fit the description). As new age music fans began to discover the ethereal, haunting properties of certain strains of Celtic music, some Celtic pop grew to encompass those tendencies as well, incorporating synthesizers in addition to standard acoustic-based instrumentation (but not quite to the same degree as Celtic fusion artists).

Many of the early artists associated with hypnagogic pop (including James Ferraro) actually belong to a specific American Neo-Psychedelia underground scene, centered around cassette labels such as Not Not Fun Records or New Age Tapes, that can be more often than not simply described with other terms, such as Drone, Noise or Progressive Electronic. However, even these artists have become a lot more transparent and the usage of the term hypnagogic pop has become increasingly relevant.&nbsp;\nEven so, it is often confused with Chillwave. Some early chillwave artists, such as Nite Jewel, are borderline cases indeed, but, in time, chillwave has established itself as a full-blown niche with a specific sound, using lo-fi to a much smaller degree than hypnagogic pop, more conventional and accessible song formats (followed with more acclaim, as hypnagogic pop artists are often discarded as being too abrasive), as well as having its own themes and stereotypical sounds. Same notes apply almost entirely to other arguable offshoots, such as Witch House.","songs":[{"id":"xNbI3T15342","name":"Hello Welcome","artist":"bBMeeDq43e20"},{"id":"xLuIApb3381","name":"Polish Girl","artist":"b70sf5851"},{"id":"U5DReF266d7","name":"Corvette Cassette","artist":"iQVQ1415d"},{"id":"bf00vNF4b595","name":"Ivy Covered House","artist":"Mcp6c8c4"},{"id":"JC6WEC313ff","name":"Solitude","artist":"b1R8hP527d0"},{"id":"xLxrZGaec2c","name":"Baby","artist":"cCOT4fc4a"},{"id":"mSpvrhedef2","name":"Lying Has To Stop","artist":"yiuewFd3434"},{"id":"mSMyGq8a660","name":"后青年启示录","artist":"dWTy8qf7b8b"},{"id":"mQFaEU5fb5b","name":"Dream Beat (Romare Remix)","artist":"bmzDd788f"},{"id":"mQXH0pa138d","name":"－我 无 悔－","artist":"nij6jg79a41"},{"id":"mQ9fmY720b1","name":"Hey Moon","artist":"boi91308d"},{"id":"xN8aVxaedd9","name":"迷失荷爾蒙","artist":"J3G95fde"}],"albums":[{"id":"URVo9s28690","name":"All Over You","artist":"UNq7Ge29403"},{"id":"NiOkg7209bf","name":"Paradise...

Lyrics are dominated by themes of love and romance, and explicit material, as well as songs about Islam-forbidden things and practices (such as drinking alcohol) are very rare.","songs":[{"id":"OKjme4436","name":"Breton Medley","artist":"Wlra14f9"},{"id":"mQ6IdV6566e","name":"Ya Kothor","artist":"biM3a8503"},{"id":"fDAHz3eaa4","name":"Tamally Maak (Always With You)","artist":"b4nC17b42"},{"id":"mQ7ibM578a0","name":"Bang Bang","artist":"baMGd3188"},{"id":"mQ3SJ75ae78","name":"Kidda","artist":"dBKm66956"},{"id":"JBa9lb230f2","name":"shax'nazilar","artist":"8O8jUEe4c2e"},{"id":"b1pWZ5j3dda4","name":"Forgotten Promises","artist":"bW1B250c3"},{"id":"8Gi3UPe73fb","name":"In Your Eyes...","artist":"bh7Lbf4b0"},{"id":"8GrOhtfb54e","name":"Jenim Yarey","artist":"cQwhBa99998"},{"id":"b31So9d5af","name":"Ya Rayah","artist":"bL5a20452"},{"id":"xL8YVN9ed13","name":"Khodny Bein Aydeek","artist":"dlz06rc9e2a"},{"id":"mQ4p8j7fc62","name":"Albi Nadak","artist":"Ho87b791"}],"albums":[{"id":"ns7Uf4422","name":"Portals of Grace","artist":"Wlra14f9"},{"id":"keK4ab91c","name":"7","artist":"biM3a8503"},{"id":"bQKeGP59b8d","name":"Muhebbet Sorap/寻爱之路","artist":"8O8jUEe4c2e"},{"id":"jEo6da22a","name":"Tamally Maak","artist":"b4nC17b42"},{"id":"fDKQ8e2ba","name":"The Best of Natacha Atlas","artist":"dBKm66956"},{"id":"g2dgaL2bba3","name":"Xush Kaldingiz","artist":"8O8jUEe4c2e"},{"id":"khaUd1e03","name":"Les Annees Orlando Vol.12: Esc...","artist":"baMGd3188"},{"id":"moxe6neba88","name":"Ashiq Kuyi","artist":"cQwhBa99998"},{"id":"bnmLif93dc4","name":"Taqdirimsan Baxtimsan","artist":"8O8jUEe4c2e"},{"id":"0JOE31075","name":"Shakhbat Shakhabit","artist":"biM3a8503"},{"id":"5goP38318","name":"Wherever You Are","artist":"bW1B250c3"},{"id":"khbMbc6b7","name":"Les Annees Barclay Vol.9: Le T...","artist":"baMGd3188"}],"artists":[{"id":"Wlra14f9","name":"Azam Ali"},{"id":"biM3a8503","name":"Nancy Ajram"},{"id":"dBKm66956","name":"Natacha Atlas"},{"id":"THZZt0288ec","name":"黄觉"},{"id":"bh7Lbf4b0","name":"Elissa"},{"id":"bW1B250c3","name":"Sami Yusuf"},{"id":"b4nC17b42","name":"Amr Diab"},{"id":"bL5a20452","name":"Rachid Taha"},{"id":"G0v502f1","name":"Yasmine Hamdan"},{"id":"UCLd2dbb","name":"Franco Battiato"},{"id":"Ho87b791","name":"Amal Hijazi"},{"id":"cbgE209d6","name":"Nawal Al Zoghbi"}]},{"type":"style","id":"9001","name":"卧室流行 Bedroom Pop","description":"卧室流行（Bedroom Pop），是新生代音乐人中流行的一种音乐风格，最初是由于许多独立的音乐人负担不起较高价钱的音源，而采用比较便宜的Lo-Fi的音源及效果，慢慢的流行起了这样一种风格。卧室流行的音乐带着像梦幻流行的音色和，旋律与歌词却带着一点青少年的细腻与搞怪，唱腔也非常的肆意。歌曲的封面也是非常随性的邻家自拍，整体看上去制作成本较低却透出一种可爱，这种类型的音乐逐渐走进了大众音乐的视野。","songs":[],"albums":[{"id":"yhPQE9c024b","name":"Late Bloomer","artist":"nn9AZQ5b65e"},{"id":"xqqGOpba166","name":"Ontario Gothic","artist":"bJfqMEe7440"},{"id":"yhPC9Za1614","name":"The Lowerpace Project","artist":"yiu161b32ac"},{"id":"JXuWMo1e376","name":"Lo Que Siento","artist":"yiuoy3c4a8f"},{"id":"yhPiBrdf161","name":"Care","artist":"nn9rTk908b9"},{"id":"yhOGjUbfb38","name":"Let It Pass","artist":"JXQgFQ219e8"},{"id":"nnihdr61f83","name":"in love","artist":"9dgjr9f8fb1"},{"id":"nnej747f42a","name":"dancing","artist":"nn9rvY6cba7"},{"id":"bC7hQQG45e41","name":"Songs4u","artist":"yiuoy3c4a8f"},{"id":"9c99LOec78f","name":"this_era","artist":"yiuh0Fcac56"},{"id":"yhPkI0c06aa","name":"So Polite","artist":"b1CSkdE3f20e"},{"id":"9czFqwee861","name":"Sales LP","artist":"yfWPVda1364"}],"artists":[{"id":"yiuoy3c4a8f","name":"cuco"},{"id":"JXQldP1eb74","name":"Clairo"},{"id":"b1CSkdE3f20e","name":"Summer Salt"},{"id":"nn9jZu5a702","name":"Vansire"},{"id":"bJfqMEe7440","name":"Foxes in Fiction"},{"id":"nn9rvY6cba7","name":"mellow fellow"},{"id":"bBMeeDq43e20","name":"Homeshake"},{"id":"9dgjr9f8fb1","name":"vietra"},{"id":"JXQgFQ219e8","name":"Jakob Ogawa"},{"id":"nn9rTk908b9","name":"TEMPOREX"},{"id":"nn9AlH6491c","name":"keshi"},{"id":"yiuiFha9e8a","name":"CASTLEBEAT"}]},{"type":"style","id":"802","name":"弗拉明戈流行 Flamenco Pop","description":"Originally developed in the mid 1960s, incorporated palos flamencos (Flamenco subgenres) and Copla into the format of feisty and lively Pop music (particularly, Yé-Yé). It was strongly influenced by Rumba Flamenca, but Flamenco Pop isn't a palo flamenco, and is considered 'pop aflamencado', pop with some flamenco overtones, such as the singing style and rhythms. \nSince the late 1990s the new acts of Flamenco Pop are commonly referred as 'Flamenkito', a style where ballads and mid-tempos are frequent too, and it has more contemporary influences such as Dance-Pop or even Reggaeton. It is dismissed by critics by its superficial and clichéd 'light' flamenco elements. Nonetheless, it has become very popular amongst a young audience that in most cases isn't interested in more pure forms of flamenco music. Some of the most popular Flamenco Pop artists in the 1960s/1970s were Encarnita Polo and Rosa Morena. In the 1990s Azúcar Moreno was the most succesful band.

Outside influences have impacted Hawaiian music since foreign colonizers arrived on the island in the late 18th century, all bringing sounds from their homelands that would be adopted and mixed into the island's folk music. Hawaii's tourism boom of the 1930s popularized the island's music on the mainland while the 1940s and '50s found artists like Sol Hoopii crossing over to the pop charts by bringing jazz and big band music into the mix. Don Ho became the island's unofficial musical ambassador to the world with his easy-listening blend in the 1960s. The \"Hawaiian Renaissance\" movement of the 1970s favored traditional elements and traditional artists, but rock and soul music was still popular with the younger generation and remained influential into the 21st century. Besides a healthy rock scene, Hawaii is also home to a growing number of hip-hop artists who use the Hawaiian language in their lyrics. Jawaiian music -- a mix of reggae and Hawaiian music -- exploded on the island in the 1990s and introduced the artist Israel Kamakawiwo'ole. Like many Hawaiian pop artists, superstar Kamakawiwo'ole -- or \"IZ\" -- borrowed from numerous popular genres while retaining distinctive elements from the traditional music of the island.","songs":[{"id":"bqvgDlD383cb","name":"Over The Rainbow","artist":"53T8fed4"},{"id":"bf0zAWk2ff29","name":"Toad Song","artist":"5Po94143"},{"id":"TpaI90164","name":"Haole Hula","artist":"bdf99e721"},{"id":"b4xq4ba54e","name":"Breaking the Waves","artist":"bv57f9bb9"},{"id":"OyK74fee5","name":"Make It Up To You","artist":"53L61802"},{"id":"8GpGzhfe583","name":"Makee 'Ailana","artist":"blvPe02ed"},{"id":"xNv2g5ac403","name":"Lovely Lei Llima","artist":"yhDzPodebe0"},{"id":"xNwweybb653","name":"Promise of Dawn","artist":"beqrc669a"},{"id":"mSDvDC82df0","name":"White Christmas","artist":"dkrr38cb1"},{"id":"xNxn7Mfe025","name":"The Little Drummer Boy/Winter Aloha","artist":"5Pa8d819"},{"id":"mSBAE76cd86","name":"Lei Ho`Oheno","artist":"eHh056f6a"},{"id":"chBMked54a","name":"Put a Little Love","artist":"V4Td46d7"}],"albums":[{"id":"gdEM59011","name":"Somewhere Over the Rainbow","artist":"53T8fed4"},{"id":"nLVYf4fa0","name":"Sweet & Lovely","artist":"bdf99e721"},{"id":"9cLKft198ba","name":"Eagle","artist":"nnApFs9134b"},{"id":"qy8tmD82d0d","name":"Shining Soul mix Vol.5","artist":"dz3ll1f1596"},{"id":"eKmk7de12","name":"Wonderful World","artist":"53T8fed4"},{"id":"iWyBd33af","name":"Night Music","artist":"53L61802"},{"id":"3Viv3af26","name":"Carving a Crimson Career","artist":"bv57f9bb9"},{"id":"otkxf39b7","name":"Ki Ho'alu: Journey of Hawaiian...","artist":"blvPe02ed"},{"id":"yhRsdTaa8ee","name":"Mana Road","artist":"beqrc669a"},{"id":"nnglZJ55d3f","name":"Lovely Hawaii","artist":"yhDzPodebe0"},{"id":"9cCBZke684d","name":"Songs of Polynesia","artist":"yhDzPodebe0"},{"id":"nnglZI5d754","name":"Isle of Golden Dreams","artist":"yhDzPodebe0"}],"artists":[{"id":"53T8fed4","name":"Israel Kamakawiwo'ole"},{"id":"cCqE4dc01","name":"Anjani"},{"id":"b3WGf5e59","name":"Tia Carrere"},{"id":"d1Am3d797","name":"Kalapana"},{"id":"bdf99e721","name":"Raiatea"},{"id":"53L61802","name":"Cecilio & Kapono"},{"id":"53W668cd","name":"Nã Leo Pilimehana"},{"id":"bv5Cf6f89","name":"Hapa"},{"id":"beqrc669a","name":"Kohala"},{"id":"V4Kd3b62","name":"Don Ho"},{"id":"bv5Bf5828","name":"Ekolu"},{"id":"dRAW47fcc","name":"Teresa Bright"}]},{"type":"style","id":"604","name":"印度流行 Indian Pop","description":"印度音乐的起源是隐藏在音乐创作者美丽的神话之中。印度人认为印度音乐 是由湿婆神「Shiva」所创造的。在印度，对於古代音乐之权威者中，最伟大的人物，即使在今日的印度仍然 受到音乐家们尊敬崇拜的，应该是13世纪初的莎兰咖提瓦(Sharangadeva)这位圣者。之后由於伊斯兰教入侵北方, 逐间影响南北音乐风格的区别, 而北方信伊斯兰教的国王阿克巴（1542－1605 A.D）则是一个非 常喜爱音乐的君主。因此，在他治理期间，其宫廷乐师Tan Sen开创了北印度音乐之先河, 印度音乐的raga(拉格)受到他的影响，而发生了很大的变化。另外印度 的室内乐，亦从阿克巴大帝即位之后，与印度寺院的音乐、戏剧等，一并获得了很好的发展。\n\n印度音乐要素中，拍子占有极为重要地位。印度人对於拍子相当重视，这是来 自於他们自古以来的作诗法和诗的韵律之观念。因为在印度，无论是梵语或是地区方言,全部的音节都是适应 其时间的长短而被分类的。另一方面，由於印度的诗完全没有所谓的强弱音节之分，所以他们以时间的长短分 配做为分割法。目前的印度语言学者，对於诗中各种各样的拍子仍然相当的重视，而且也要求的非常严格，甚 至有些学者仍然依照诗的韵律法来教习。印度人对於节奏的感觉或有关时间之继续，皆非常的敏感和熟悉。这 也是印度人所以很容易将歌词或诗配上音乐或将音乐填上歌词或诗的原因。除此之外，印度人对於各种各样节 奏组合的预判能力也很强。例如印度人在鼓的即兴演奏中，能够很快速地而正确地判断大鼓的节拍法，是由二 拍加四拍或由七拍加二拍加七拍…..等节奏型组成的。\n\n印度音乐如同其他民族音乐一样自成一格，强烈反映出其风土民情与生活型态。 印度音乐极富宗教性，一如印度的文明著重於心灵的精神层面一般，民族音乐复杂、神秘而多样化，且具有冥 想的性灵音乐特色。\n\n印度音乐大致可分为南印度音乐与北印度音乐两派，虽然演奏乐器及歌曲风格不同， 但音乐用语及理论却是相通的。西塔琴是北印度的代表乐器。北印度音乐受回教文化及波斯音乐的影响，属宫 廷音乐一类，与具有印度教浓厚色彩的南印度音乐性质大异其趣。\n\n印度音乐丰富而复杂的传统，实在是今天是世界音乐文化最丰富的宝藏，也正应验了这个历史攸久民族的伟大，在印度音乐中，我们常可以发现一些在其他音乐文化中已经失传的特质，音乐所具有的特殊力量与宗教情怀，即兴演奏的特殊能力，音乐与数学与整个宇宙之间特殊的关系等等；许多现代的音乐家，无论是古典的或是流行的，都由从印度音乐中寻找灵感的例子，但相对起来，真正研究印度音乐，演奏印度音乐仍然仅局限在印度人自己，我想，我们应该先从欣赏印度音乐开始，进而了解实践，必定能够开拓我们的听觉的领域，丰富我们的文化。\n\nIndia lays claim to the largest and most prolific film industry in the world, with these movies determining the pop music trends of any given moment in time.

Russian popular performers in full acquainted with the world of music experiences, borrow a lot of it, especially in terms of arrangements. In the late 2000s, the Russian market of Pop joined the transitional period. Due to a serious drop in sales in the form of physical media (which is typical for the industry worldwide), there is a reclassification of labels to sell music through the Internet (mostly so-called digital singles). By 2009, album sales have dropped significantly when compared to 1990s and mid 2000s due to increasing sales of digital content (digital singles, ringtones, ringback tones, etc).","songs":[{"id":"mSsYQZ77cf4","name":"Команда","artist":"byGHfe63a"},{"id":"mQDRmE4ebaa","name":"A Simple Motion","artist":"94n7c605"},{"id":"xN959B9bcdc","name":"Витамин","artist":"nnA1Y46a2a6"},{"id":"mTepzS800f7","name":"Любите друг друга","artist":"mEIuHZ57072"},{"id":"mSPR2295f6a","name":"Ракета","artist":"K7S66f6a"},{"id":"mTf4MY83963","name":"胡桃夹子","artist":"bC7DkMu451c1"},{"id":"8I6y5Of86ad","name":"Холостяк","artist":"9dfavI24336"},{"id":"mSXfTY768ad","name":"Люблю его","artist":"Egx52301"},{"id":"8INPFse40b4","name":"Между строчек","artist":"blgFc62c6"},{"id":"8IK40r1c43b","name":"流浪地球（instrumental）","artist":"yi0QJwaa478"},{"id":"bCmY7Yk45d63","name":"ВСПОМИНАТЬ","artist":"Hl78fd0c"},{"id":"mSUAH85e814","name":"Принимай меня","artist":"9dfjgZed033"}],"albums":[{"id":"gYB986c5","name":"错位","artist":"s8s3ad4f"},{"id":"oVuJe8c87","name":"200 km/h In the Wrong Lane: 10...","artist":"94n7c605"},{"id":"9c9YEiecc1a","name":"Команда","artist":"byGHfe63a"},{"id":"nnkqdL91bfb","name":"Любите друг друга","artist":"mEIuHZ57072"},{"id":"nnioCx52285","name":"Витамин","artist":"nnA1Y46a2a6"},{"id":"nni5ml5c087","name":"Не молчи (The Remixes)","artist":"bQQp20cb5"},{"id":"nniWSBe6852","name":"По улицам Москвы","artist":"blguac167"},{"id":"nnl4h187517","name":"流浪地球结尾的歌","artist":"yi0QJwaa478"},{"id":"9cHU8Nfc594","name":"Як плакала вона","artist":"yiuxWRdb96d"},{"id":"nniTsd7b65b","name":"Сильная девочка (& Винтаж)","artist":"9cCtTIe815a"},{"id":"b1C1SPr42054","name":"Танцуй","artist":"9deBudef6b7"},{"id":"nnlIF85e527","name":"Неизвестный исполнитель","artist":"9dfFdl17567"}],"artists":[{"id":"94n7c605","name":"t.A.T.u"},{"id":"bfUlad808","name":"Алексей Гоман"},{"id":"biMcbf58f","name":"Polina Gagarina"},{"id":"bky9b162b","name":"Алексей Воробьёв"},{"id":"bqcsd35d2","name":"Сати Казанова"},{"id":"m4aFIZ660e9","name":"Юлианна Караулова"},{"id":"dl17j0c6d64","name":"Dropgun"},{"id":"b9CGedb32","name":"Баста"},{"id":"m1voWh78d42","name":"Natalie Gioia"},{"id":"b8NF18afc","name":"Жанна Фриске"},{"id":"czZD2b3cf","name":"Lena Katina"},{"id":"bC7e8mN450c3","name":"Jama"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1075","name":"土耳其流行 Turkish Pop","description":"土耳其音乐大致可分为古典音乐和民间音乐两大类。古典音乐包括宫廷艺术音乐、宗教音乐和奥斯曼军乐；民间音乐则由于地理和历史的原因，有着丰富多采的地方特色。塞尔柱和奥斯曼帝国的宫廷艺术音乐，采用阿拉伯-波斯风格；同时，其理论家和作曲家，亦对土耳其音乐艺术的发展作出了自己的贡献。\n土耳其古典音乐的调式体系虽然是建立在阿拉伯－波斯的基础上，但它发展得更为精细。\n土耳其的音程计算以“库玛”为基本单位，每个库玛为22～23音分，常用的音程有5种，分别包含4、5、8、9、12个库玛。4个库玛为小半音；5个库玛为大半音；8个库玛为小全音；9个库玛为大全音；12个库玛接近增二度。\n土耳其音乐的调式称作“玛卡姆”，其种类繁多，部分来自波斯-阿拉伯，部分为土耳其人所创造。\n土耳其音乐的节奏，主要以鼓来体现，同阿拉伯音乐一样，也是根据鼓不同时值的低音“迪姆”和高音“泰克”鼓点作各种组合来形成繁多的节奏型的。这种节奏型的周期性反复叫做“乌苏尔”。其中包括各种拍子，还有由48拍和88拍为一个周期的。音乐家在进行创作时，根据乐曲特性，选定一种乌苏尔通曲使用。但技艺高超的演奏家，对它却常加以变奏。\n土耳其音乐的形式结构多样，歌曲严格遵循奥斯曼时代的诗词格律，并成为曲式的基础。声乐形式，有散板的“加泽尔”和“塔克西姆·莱亚利”以及以各种乌苏尔构成的“沙尔克”、“贝斯泰”、“卡尔”等。其中沙尔克也常作为古典歌曲的总称。器乐中最常见的形式是“塔克西姆”和“佩什雷夫”。塔克西姆是乐器即兴独奏，也常用作乐曲的序奏或不同玛卡姆乐曲之间的过渡；佩什雷夫则是固定节拍的器乐合奏，通常作为前奏。土耳其古典音乐中最重要的体裁叫“法瑟尔”，它是一种大型的多乐章的声乐和器乐组曲。乐曲一般首先是一段塔克西姆，然后是器乐合奏，接着是使用一玛卡姆的声乐和器乐段落。法瑟尔所用的乐器主要有坦布尔、乌德、凯门恰、卡侬、内伊、达夫等；声乐则以男声合唱为主，也有用混声合唱的。\n土耳其的乐器种类很多，古典音乐和民间音乐所使用的乐器是不相同的。古典音乐所用主要乐器，弦乐器有坦布尔、乌德、卡侬，弓弦乐器亚伊勒·坦布尔、凯门恰·鲁米，管乐器有7孔竖笛内伊，膜鸣乐器有代夫和马兹哈尔、库迪姆，体鸣乐器有钹、济尔。奥斯曼军乐是土耳其古典音乐和民间音乐相结合的产物，它使用的管乐器有祖尔纳、博鲁；鼓类有纳卡拉、克斯、达武尔、达伊拉；体鸣乐器有济尔、指挥杖恰阿纳。民间乐器中弦乐器有萨兹、凯门恰；管乐器有祖尔纳、图卢姆、卡瓦尔、迪迪克、梅伊；鼓类有达尔布卡、代布莱克、达夫、达武尔；体鸣乐器有卡舍克等。\n19世纪起，西洋音乐开始传入土耳其，给土耳其的传统音乐以很大的冲击，但音乐家们仍努力保持其传统的曲式和民族的音调。由于采用了和声手法，在音律上不得不改用12平均律；众多调式中，常用的也只剩下与大小调有关的数种。现代流行音乐通过无线电和咖啡馆广为传播，在青年中影响尤大，呈现着西洋音乐与土耳其传统音乐并存的局面。\n\nTurkish pop music is now everywhere, whether it's the latest from Tarkan, female singer/songwriter Sezen Aksu, or the more radical sounds of the Turkish club underground, like Mercan Dede.\nInterestingly, the fusion of sounds work so well that Turkish pop music does not sound as Westernised as Indian or Indonesian pop even though it does include global influences such as technological developments from the west, western harmonies grafted onto folk songs, influences from Arabic music and, of course, American-influenced rap and hip-hop from artists such as Erci-E.\nIn the early 90s, Turkish gangster rap surged in popularity as artists such as Gokturk \"G-Force\" Sevinc influenced a younger generation newly exposed to Americas \"West-Coast\" culture. Gokturk had a string of hits including the #1 single \"Istanbul G's\" however fell from grace in the mid 90s due to a well publicised falling out with collaborator Erci-E.\nMany music critics argue that the surge of Turkstar (Pop Idol) type competitions on Turkish TV has only added to the pop industry's shallow image, and is cited as the reason why underground and reactionary music is becoming more popular.","songs":[{"id":"xLt7ZWc5213","name":"夜空中最亮的星","artist":"eaMJ70b1e"},{"id":"TOp877c6a","name":"Simarik","artist":"b4hGef250"},{"id":"cqsgKf3f36","name":"1453 Fetih","artist":"EJ65b192"},{"id":"bf0ArPS2ed1f","name":"Simaying （Mutallip Ahat）","artist":"x3xvHOde6d6"},{"id":"mQ4bHX5f496","name":"Dum Tek Tek","artist":"bgYz97b49"},{"id":"mQC6ds8e1fd","name":"Bir Harmanim Bu Aksam","artist":"eFAu79848"},{"id":"xL2Vx89a96e","name":"Kalbine Sürgün","artist":"CnXC43d8f"},{"id":"mQCaGXc4f95","name":"Sevgilim","artist":"dHUH40d4d"},{"id":"8GeIcIf2041","name":"Kalamam Arkadaş","artist":"KA0620f2"},{"id":"bCk9DeX49b4b","name":"Istanbul Istanbul Olali (Since Istanbul Has Been...)","artist":"bj7lc23f0"},{"id":"U59i2A4307e","name":"Daha Erken","artist":"GgJ7265d"},{"id":"xLsuKmc9146","name":"Gülüm","artist":"LEo7eb00"}],"albums":[{"id":"g2dgaL2bba3","name":"Xush Kaldingiz","artist":"8O8jUEe4c2e"},{"id":"f1E3ae545","name":"Olurum Sana","artist":"b4hGef250"},{"id":"moxe6neba88","name":"Ashiq Kuyi","artist":"cQwhBa99998"},{"id":"f1E69285f","name":"Dudu","artist":"b4hGef250"},{"id":"jHbSae544","name":"1453 - Sultanlar Aşkına","artist":"EJ65b192"},{"id":"bnmLif93dc4","name":"Taqdirimsan Baxtimsan","artist":"8O8jUEe4c2e"},{"id":"ooG51999f","name":"Adimi Kalbine Yaz","artist":"b4hGef250"},{"id":"xFK1Gtc362b","name":"Yadigar","artist":"CnXC43d8f"},{"id":"ouHVedcb2","name":"Kara Kedi","artist":"LLe87eba"},{"id":"otD3e38f8","name":"BAŞKA","artist":"GgJ7265d"},{"id":"oNrR175e6","name":"Herkes Ayni Hayatta","artist":"eFAu79848"},{"id":"k8xEc170e","name":"Hayat Bi Gün","artist":"ndf3eee7a"}],"artists":[{"id":"mOtII0d8cb3","name":"The Bedstars"},{"id":"THZZt0288ec","name":"黄觉"},{"id":"b4hGef250","name":"Tarkan"},{"id":"KA0620f2","name":"Murat Boz"},{"id":"dHUH40d4d","name":"Mustafa Ceceli"},{"id":"EJ65b192","name":"Can Atilla"},{"id":"KFE5495b","name":"Soner Sarıkabadayı"},{"id":"bpu0bf017","name":"Omar Faruk Tekbilek"},{"id":"GgJ7265d","name":"Gökhan Özen"},{"id":"LLe87eba","name":"Serdar Ortaç"},{"id":"bDqH1ad14","name":"Atiye Deniz"},{"id":"eFAu79848","name":"Mehmet Erdem"}]},{"type":"style","id":"774","name":"人声合唱团 Vocal Group","description":"人声合唱团根基于预录时代的游吟曲风和前理发店派四重奏的一种风格，证明从20世纪20年代和50年代成为一种兼具流行性和艺术感的艺术风格。此风格在二战期间因为安德鲁斯姐妹的巨大成功而盛行。\n\nA style with deep roots in the pre-recorded era of minstrelsy and barber-shop quartets, Harmony Vocal Group proved a popular, artistic style of music from the 1920s well into the '50s.

It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.\nMusically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with bass guitar and drums. Typically, rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature utilizing a verse-chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse and common musical characteristics are difficult to define. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis. The dominance of rock by white, male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music. Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and an ideology of authenticity than pop music.\nBy the late 1960s, referred to as the \"golden age\" or \"classic rock\" period, a number of distinct rock music sub-genres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, and jazz-rock fusion, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the counter-cultural psychedelic scene. New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring major sub-genre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw, energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques. Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other sub-genres, including new wave, post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion sub-genres have since emerged, including pop punk, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the garage rock/post-punk and synthpop revivals at the beginning of the new millennium.\nRock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major sub-cultures including mods and rockers in the UK and the hippie counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s. Similarly, 1970s punk culture spawned the visually distinctive goth and emo subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song, rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, sex and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity.","songs":[{"id":"mSezC888add","name":"后来的我们","artist":"dz264c5b"},{"id":"mQVQPC88ad6","name":"生活不止眼前的苟且","artist":"f32b5ea7"},{"id":"bf08Lhx31b5a","name":"Sugar","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"eVAa7ab0e","name":"海阔天空","artist":"i4rf3a38"},{"id":"b1pXM6x3ec7f","name":"Counting Stars","artist":"6kd4f392"},{"id":"xLDMDIcc5c1","name":"春风十里","artist":"nmSu3A90eaf"},{"id":"0LpT335d1","name":"爱我别走","artist":"ihyffebb"},{"id":"b6ochace3f","name":"Almost Lover","artist":"89u83382"},{"id":"b4KjOd4e94","name":"Free Loop","artist":"dSuI44e4a"},{"id":"xNc1pNd671f","name":"凡人歌","artist":"6lW8ce0a"},{"id":"zVLG3108d","name":"Young For You","artist":"dtM943a6"},{"id":"8Gasnd1cabc","name":"Need You Now (Single Version)","artist":"WfKc4a9a"}],"albums":[{"id":"nmTM4c70144","name":"自传","artist":"dz264c5b"},{"id":"k1a8a8003","name":"世界","artist":"eaMJ70b1e"},{"id":"b8qsCb15a2","name":"Ⅴ","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"yhE9gU9805b","name":"生活不止眼前的苟且","artist":"f32b5ea7"},{"id":"jfQKd334e","name":"Beyond 25th Anniversary","artist":"i4rf3a38"},{"id":"3GT565ed","name":"海阔天空","artist":"i4rf3a38"},{"id":"kMDM98f09","name":"Native","artist":"6kd4f392"},{"id":"c9Lb3361a","name":"光辉岁月十五年","artist":"i4rf3a38"},{"id":"yhElOy9ae25","name":"此时此刻 巡回演唱会","artist":"f32b5ea7"},{"id":"dSg61c0d","name":"爱你伍佰年","artist":"Mc9971d"},{"id":"zca4a05d","name":"秘密基地","artist":"ihyffebb"},{"id":"km5a151b3","name":"追梦痴子心","artist":"dtM943a6"}],"artists":[{"id":"dz264c5b","name":"五月天"},{"id":"i4rf3a38","name":"Beyond"},{"id":"f32b5ea7","name":"许巍"},{"id":"bwkd183b2","name":"Maroon 5"},{"id":"cmjk2cad8","name":"Avril Lavigne"},{"id":"c936e2bf","name":"汪峰"},{"id":"dy27de04","name":"苏打绿"},{"id":"6e095c23","name":"Coldplay"},{"id":"6lW8ce0a","name":"萧敬腾"},{"id":"WhLb3425","name":"Linkin Park"},{"id":"xLLCPdd5f3b","name":"华晨宇"},{"id":"E2P77875","name":"Carly Rae Jepsen"}],"styles":[{"type":"style","id":"322","name":"摇滚 Rock & Roll","description":"从最纯粹的形式来讲，所谓摇滚，就是三和弦加强硬持续的鼓点加上口的旋律。早期摇滚的音乐来源非常广泛，主要的包括布鲁斯、R&B、和乡村音乐，其它还有福音音乐、传统的流行乐、爵士、以及民间音乐。所有的这些影响加在一起构成了一种简单的以布鲁斯为基础的歌曲结构，它是快速的、适于跳舞的、而且容易让人记住的。第一批摇滚明星们 — Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly, Bo Diddley, Bill Haley, Gene Vincent, the Everly Brothers, Carl Perkins,还有好多其它的明星 — 确立了摇滚乐的模式，并且在以后的四十年内都一直为人们所追随。在每一个十年当中，总是有很多艺人复制着第一批摇滚乐手们的音乐，而剩下的那些艺人，有的扩大了摇滚原先的定义、有的则彻底打破了这种流派被限定的模式。从英式入侵、民间摇滚、迷幻摇滚，再到硬摇滚、重金属、华丽摇滚，再到朋克，事实上每一种摇滚的分支流派在产生的最初都是忠于摇滚最基本的结构的。但是一旦这样的改变发生，传统的摇滚就从流行榜上渐渐消失了 — 当然，也有一些艺人始终都保持着光芒。有一些乐队，比如 the Rolling Stones 和 the Faces,他们始终坚持着传统摇滚最基本的规则，但他们把音乐做得更加快速更加自由。其它的一些乐队，比如原型朋克the Velvet Underground, the New York Dolls, 以及 the Stooges,他们保留了基础的音乐结构，但他们的行为中有了更多威吓性的元素。还有一些艺人成为了摇滚的传统主义者，比如 Dave Edmunds 和 Graham Parker, 他们写的歌出的唱片，从来就没有离开过50年代末60年代初的摇滚模式。虽然在摇滚出现后的这几十年里，摇滚这个词已经开始指代越来越多不同的音乐风格，但是这种音乐的本质从未改变过。 \n\nIn its purest form, Rock & Roll has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody. Early rock & roll drew from a variety of sources, primarily blues, R&B, and country, but also gospel, traditional pop, jazz, and folk. All of these influences combined in a simple, blues-based song structure that was fast, danceable, and catchy. The first wave of rock & rollers -- Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly, Bo Diddley, Bill Haley, Gene Vincent, the Everly Brothers, and Carl Perkins, among many others -- set the template for rock & roll that was followed over the next four decades. During each decade, a number of artists replicated the sound of the first rockers, while some expanded that definition and others completely exploded the constrictions of the genre. From the British Invasion, folk-rock, psychedelia, and through hard rock, heavy metal, glam rock, and punk, most subgenres of rock & roll initially demonstrated an allegiance to the basic structure of rock & roll. Once these permutations emerged, traditional rock & roll faded away from the pop charts, yet there were always artists that kept the flame alive. Some, like the Rolling Stones and the Faces, adhered to the basic rules of traditional rock & roll but played the music fast and loose. Others, like proto-punk rockers the Velvet Underground, the New York Dolls, and the Stooges, kept the basic song structure, but played it with more menace. Still others, like Dave Edmunds and Graham Parker, became rock & roll traditionalists, writing and recording music that never wavered from the sound of the late '50s and early '60s. Although the term \"rock & roll\" came to refer to a number of different music styles in the decades following its inception, the essential form of the music never changed.","songs":[{"id":"eVAa7ab0e","name":"海阔天空","artist":"i4rf3a38"},{"id":"F3T5b6ae","name":"挪威的森林","artist":"Mc9971d"},{"id":"fOOI624e6","name":"爱要怎么说出口","artist":"cUW5e566"},{"id":"becCc396b","name":"怒放的生命","artist":"c936e2bf"},{"id":"PKBZ4e5b0","name":"La La La","artist":"7Ua5459f"},{"id":"jmpz161cc","name":"听不到","artist":"dz264c5b"},{"id":"fP0l926d6","name":"私奔","artist":"cVp8b701"},{"id":"fO7s7a822","name":"无地自容","artist":"fV899886"},{"id":"KFxN5de90","name":"Imagine","artist":"2Ho88357"},{"id":"xLsia2b8f1f","name":"杀死那个石家庄人","artist":"b45qfebee"},{"id":"eXLXZ3700d","name":"公路之歌","artist":"iBD193db"}],"albums":[{"id":"jfQKd334e","name":"Beyond 25th Anniversary","artist":"i4rf3a38"},{"id":"3GT565ed","name":"海阔天空","artist":"i4rf3a38"},{"id":"c9Lb3361a","name":"光辉岁月十五年","artist":"i4rf3a38"},{"id":"dSg61c0d","name":"爱你伍佰年","artist":"Mc9971d"},{"id":"wwCr2ac0e","name":"黄家驹原作精选集","artist":"i4rf3a38"},{"id":"or9259ed","name":"爱情的尽头","artist":"Mc9971d"},{"id":"jFhPb90f2","name":"不要停止我的音乐","artist":"iBD193db"},{"id":"d48B41cdf","name":"黑豹 同名专辑","artist":"fV899886"},{"id":"wfc3d173","name":"忘情1015","artist":"Mc9971d"},{"id":"gvWa232f","name":"怒放的生命","artist":"c936e2bf"},{"id":"fUvC774d6","name":"万能青年旅店 同名专辑","artist":"b45qfebee"},{"id":"w1A4389f","name":"约定","artist":"cUW5e566"}],"artists":[{"id":"i4rf3a38","name":"Beyond"},{"id":"c936e2bf","name":"汪峰"},{"id":"c8Hl32a9c","name":"The Beatles"},{"id":"Mc9971d","name":"伍佰 & China Blue"},{"id":"bBY32965","name":"窦唯"},{"id":"dtM943a6","name":"GALA"},{"id":"b45qfebee","name":"万能青年旅店"},{"id":"sG86542","name":"崔健"},{"id":"iBD193db","name":"痛仰乐队"},{"id":"fV899886","name":"黑豹"},{"id":"2Ho88357","name":"John Lennon"},{"id":"f5ne020f","name":"张楚"}]},{"type":"style","id":"835","name":"流行摇滚 Pop Rock","description":"流行摇滚（Pop rock）是Pop音乐与摇滚乐的混合音乐，特色是使用平易近人的流行风格、明亮歌词以及吉他为基础的歌曲。流行摇滚有着许多不同的定义，从“乐观的摇滚音乐”到“Pop音乐的一个分支”。学者认为流行乐和摇滚乐常处于相反立场：流行乐的反对者常称流行乐为华而不实的商业产品，而摇滚乐的拥护者则主张摇滚乐是真实、真心、反商业的音乐。\n\n《American Popular Music》 这本书定义流行摇滚为乐观的摇滚音乐，代表歌手有艾尔顿·强、保罗·麦卡尼、艾佛利兄弟二重唱 、洛史都华、芝加哥合唱团和彼得·佛莱普顿。相反地，音乐评论家 George Starostin 将流行摇滚定义为Pop音乐的一个分支，使用平易近人的流行风格、明亮歌词以及吉他为基础的歌曲。Starostin 主张大部分被称为“power pop”的音乐都是属于流行摇滚的分支。他认为流行摇滚中充满感情的内容是“音乐的次要部份！”\n\n评论家 Philip Auslander 认为，比起英国，美国流行乐和摇滚乐之间的差异更为明显。他认为美国的流行乐是发源于如派瑞·柯摩等的白人歌手，而摇滚乐则是来自摇滚（Rock and Roll）等受到黑人影响的音乐。Auslander 指出，流行摇滚的概念，与原来彼此对立的流行乐与摇滚乐是不同的。Auslander 和其他学者如 Simon Frith 和 Grossberg，主张流行乐常被认为是不真实、虚假、商业化的一种娱乐型态。而摇滚乐则是真实的、真心的、反商业的音乐，还有一个很显著的特点：摇滚乐的内容对于社会人文有批判性的独到见解。并强调由歌手或乐团自己创作，演奏的技巧，和“与听众的连结”。\n\nSimon Frith 对于50年代到80年代流行音乐历史的分析，遭 B. J. Moore-Gilbert 的批评。他认为 Frith 和其他学者太过强调“摇滚乐”的脚色，在每个新音乐类型的字尾都加上“摇滚”。因此，当受到民谣影响的音乐开始在60年代发展，Frith称他为“民谣摇滚”，而70年代的音乐则称之为“流行摇滚”。Moore-Gilbert 认为这不合理的方式将摇滚乐放在顶点，让受到其他音乐影响的特色成为摇滚乐核心的附属品。\n\nPop rock is a music genre which mixes a catchy pop style and light lyrics in its (typically) guitar-based rock songs. There are varying definitions of the term, ranging from a slower and mellower form of rock music to a subgenre of pop music. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.\n\nPop rock has been described as an \"upbeat variety of rock music represented by artists such as Elton John, Paul McCartney, Rod Stewart, Chicago, and Peter Frampton.\" Critic Philip Auslander argues that the distinction between pop and rock is more pronounced in the US than in the UK. He claims in the US, pop has roots in white crooners such as Perry Como, whereas rock is rooted in African-American-influenced forms such as rock and roll. Auslander points out that the concept of pop rock, which blends pop and rock is at odds with the typical conception of pop and rock as opposites. Auslander and several other scholars such as Simon Frith and Grossberg argue that pop music is often depicted as an inauthentic, cynical, \"slickly commercial\" and formulaic form of entertainment. In contrast, rock music is often heralded as an authentic, sincere, and anti-commercial form of music, which emphasizes songwriting by the singers and bands, instrumental virtuosity, and a \"real connection with the audience\".\n\nSimon Frith's analysis of the history of popular music from the 1950s to the 1980s has been criticized by B. J. Moore-Gilbert, who argues that Frith and other scholars have over-emphasized the role of \"rock\" in the history of popular music by naming every new genre using the \"rock\" suffix. Thus when a folk-oriented style of music developed in the 1960s, Frith terms it \"folk rock\", and the pop-infused styles of the 1970s were called \"pop rock\". Moore-Gilbert claims that this approach unfairly puts rock at the apex, and makes every other influence become an add-on to the central core of rock.","songs":[{"id":"mSezC888add","name":"后来的我们","artist":"dz264c5b"},{"id":"mQVQPC88ad6","name":"生活不止眼前的苟且","artist":"f32b5ea7"},{"id":"bf08Lhx31b5a","name":"Sugar","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"b1pXM6x3ec7f","name":"Counting Stars","artist":"6kd4f392"},{"id":"0LpT335d1","name":"爱我别走","artist":"ihyffebb"},{"id":"b4KjOd4e94","name":"Free Loop","artist":"dSuI44e4a"},{"id":"xNc1pNd671f","name":"凡人歌","artist":"6lW8ce0a"},{"id":"8Gasnd1cabc","name":"Need You Now (Single Version)","artist":"WfKc4a9a"},{"id":"8Ghhb4eb8fb","name":"Demons","artist":"NhF6f9e0"},{"id":"mQ8pUq66e5a","name":"追梦赤子心","artist":"dtM943a6"},{"id":"eVD974564","name":"不再犹豫","artist":"i4rf3a38"},{"id":"ckCdufe206","name":"You're Beautiful","artist":"Wicaba64"}],"albums":[{"id":"nmTM4c70144","name":"自传","artist":"dz264c5b"},{"id":"k1a8a8003","name":"世界","artist":"eaMJ70b1e"},{"id":"b8qsCb15a2","name":"Ⅴ","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"yhE9gU9805b","name":"生活不止眼前的苟且","artist":"f32b5ea7"},{"id":"3GT565ed","name":"海阔天空","artist":"i4rf3a38"},{"id":"kMDM98f09","name":"Native","artist":"6kd4f392"},{"id":"yhElOy9ae25","name":"此时此刻 巡回演唱会","artist":"f32b5ea7"},{"id":"dSg61c0d","name":"爱你伍佰年","artist":"Mc9971d"},{"id":"zca4a05d","name":"秘密基地","artist":"ihyffebb"},{"id":"km5a151b3","name":"追梦痴子心","artist":"dtM943a6"},{"id":"4fw65222","name":"第一张创作专辑","artist":"dz264c5b"},{"id":"gf9R7ca27","name":"诺亚方舟 世界巡回演唱会","artist":"dz264c5b"}],"artists":[{"id":"dz264c5b","name":"五月天"},{"id":"i4rf3a38","name":"Beyond"},{"id":"f32b5ea7","name":"许巍"},{"id":"bwkd183b2","name":"Maroon 5"},{"id":"cmjk2cad8","name":"Avril Lavigne"},{"id":"6e095c23","name":"Coldplay"},{"id":"6lW8ce0a","name":"萧敬腾"},{"id":"xLLCPdd5f3b","name":"华晨宇"},{"id":"E2P77875","name":"Carly Rae Jepsen"},{"id":"eaMJ70b1e","name":"逃跑计划"},{"id":"c8Hl32a9c","name":"The Beatles"},{"id":"6kd4f392","name":"OneRepublic"}]},{"type":"style","id":"884","name":"独立摇滚 Indie Rock","description":"独立摇滚（Indie Rock），独立摇滚脱胎于80年代的地下摇滚和另类音乐，它强调乐队需要不受干扰地按照自己的思想制作音乐。独立摇滚崇尚朋克乐的“DIY”精神，具有极度鲜明的个性特色，因此很少被主流音乐所接受。同时它又借鉴了各个乐种的特色，在90年代衍生出许多风格迥异的分支。坚持自己的观点和见解就是独立摇滚的精髓所在。\n\n独立摇滚是摇滚乐在独立音乐当中发展处来的一种音乐类型。独立摇滚与独立音乐有时候可以相互替换，不过独立摇滚比较偏向于有着摇滚音乐的性质，较不同于独立流行歌曲 。不过评判是否为摇滚的标准许许多多，像是从乐器方面(电吉他，贝斯，与鼓)或是从较抽象的摇滚精神方面来评断。\n\nIndie Rock是independent rock的缩写。独立摇滚音乐人一般签约于独立唱片公司，而不是主流唱片公司。有时他们根本不签约。独立摇滚在严格意义上不是一种音乐类型（尽管这一术语通常用来特指某些乐队如人行道乐队已经受其影响的乐队），而是通常被用来泛指某一大部分推崇地下文化价值的音乐人或音乐风格，并且通常被称为摇滚音乐。与独立摇滚向关联的音乐风格或地下风格包括低保真音乐、后摇滚音乐，车库朋客，情绪摇滚，悲核音乐，c86，童稚摇滚和数字摇滚，等等；其相关（有时重叠）的音乐分类包括自赏乐队和独立流行乐。\n　　\n作为一种特点，独立摇滚音乐人将保持自身音乐和职业生涯的独立性置于首要地位，通过他们独立的唱片公司发行唱片（有时就是他们自己），并通过巡演，口口相传以及在独立电台或大学广播站播放的方式宣传。然而他们中较为流行的歌手，往往最终签约主流唱片公司 ，尽管他们的口碑通常建立在之前独立表演的成功上。\n\n\nIndie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 1980s.

As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground and less testosterone-driven perspective.

The 'alternative' definition refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music, expressed primarily in a distorted guitar sound, transgressive lyrics and generally a nonchalant, defiant attitude. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style, or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \"alternative\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).\n\nAlternative rock is a broad umbrella term consisting of music that differs greatly in terms of its sound, its social context, and its regional roots. By the end of the 1980s magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock, helping to define a number of distinct styles such as gothic rock, jangle pop, noise pop, C86, Madchester, industrial rock, and shoegazing. Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands representing them, such as Hüsker Dü and R.E.M., had even signed to major labels. But most alternative bands' commercial success was limited in comparison to other genres of rock and pop music at the time, and most acts remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became commercially successful.","songs":[{"id":"8Ghhb4eb8fb","name":"Demons","artist":"NhF6f9e0"},{"id":"TTtU54f0d","name":"Cry on My Shoulder","artist":"b4pfe610b"},{"id":"ULYh9196a","name":"Yellow","artist":"bcipfffd2"},{"id":"xLoOEyb2a93","name":"Yellow","artist":"6e095c23"},{"id":"xLrwR81280c","name":"It's Raining Again (Smile)","artist":"bz3Xf662b"},{"id":"bqvnGyd36642","name":"Stolen Dance","artist":"yfDiEsa0131"},{"id":"OI3d5c5af","name":"Won't Go Home Without You","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"xN723Idd748","name":"浪子回头","artist":"xALLzm15ee6"},{"id":"8FZpDafbabc","name":"Levi Blues","artist":"EG6580ec"},{"id":"b4CzHccd97","name":"Innocence","artist":"cmjk2cad8"},{"id":"b01HXa2958","name":"Creep","artist":"2J6912ec"},{"id":"bqvdSbl3afb8","name":"One Match","artist":"dT5x43d2a"}],"albums":[{"id":"gqWf8ba0f","name":"Continued Silence","artist":"NhF6f9e0"},{"id":"kCc614d89","name":"Night Visions","artist":"NhF6f9e0"},{"id":"dDkUDT1967d","name":"动情祭","artist":"dkavs39ab1f"},{"id":"jgqB15939","name":"It Won't Be Soon Before Long","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"jgblce4e1","name":"The Best Damn Thing","artist":"cmjk2cad8"},{"id":"yhWDmscb72b","name":"Head Above Water","artist":"cmjk2cad8"},{"id":"nnhWiOb4260","name":"卡通人物","artist":"xALLzm15ee6"},{"id":"kcZod7d87","name":"O'Dark:Thirty EP","artist":"bz3Xf662b"},{"id":"mf0LS2560e3","name":"Sadnecessary","artist":"yfDiEsa0131"},{"id":"jNzvc5a18","name":"A Little Happiness","artist":"dmo634cf5"},{"id":"EFI714cd","name":"Pablo Honey","artist":"2J6912ec"},{"id":"bU7t23af2","name":"Nevermind","artist":"2I876eb9"}],"artists":[{"id":"6e095c23","name":"Coldplay"},{"id":"WhLb3425","name":"Linkin Park"},{"id":"SGQd9a08","name":"Green Day"},{"id":"2J6912ec","name":"Radiohead"},{"id":"b45qfebee","name":"万能青年旅店"},{"id":"3xzc5875","name":"The Cranberries"},{"id":"btEqf8cf3","name":"Fall Out Boy"},{"id":"NhF6f9e0","name":"Imagine Dragons"},{"id":"6fV69232","name":"Muse"},{"id":"2I876eb9","name":"Nirvana"},{"id":"FjN8b76e","name":"RADWIMPS"},{"id":"SN6e12a8","name":"Suede"}]},{"type":"style","id":"941","name":"英伦摇滚 Britpop","description":"英式摇滚（英语：Britpop）是另类摇滚的类型之一，源自於英国九零年代初期的独立音乐圈，其中以几个受到英国六七零年代吉他流行乐影响的乐团最具代表性。这种音乐类型，发展成为对抗八零年代末及九零年初期音乐及文化的潮流，特别是针对来自美国的Grunge风潮。随著美国Grunge乐团入侵，新兴的英国乐团如Suede和Blur首先发声，自诩为反对派的音乐力量，延续过去英国吉他流行乐风，并且在歌曲中特别写入关於英国的主题。\n\n所谓\"Britpop\"，可以直接翻译成“英式摇滚”或“英伦摇滚”。britpop作为一种音乐类型，自然难以被绝对化定义，所以以下定义都是相对而言。 典型的britpop由吉它，贝司，鼓组成。当中吉他是核心，通常以简单，略带迷幻色彩的扫弦为主，其和弦走向亦主导全曲；贝司负责低音部分的旋律，通常演奏和弦中的琶音；鼓多以中速演奏。从曲风上看，britpop继承了beatles时代以来的吉他流行风格，又吸纳了60年代晚期Kinks的田园之声，中速音乐（the Who, the Small Faces），70年代的迷幻（David Bowie, T.Rax, Roxy Music），朋克和新浪潮（the Jam, the Buzzcocks, Wire, Madness, XTC, Squeeze, Elvis Costello），还有the Smiths的另类吉他流行。从内容上看，britpop大多演唱同时代英国青年自己的生活，色彩多以黯淡，颓靡，桀骜为主，也由此在短时期内迅速风靡英伦三岛。\n\nBritpop is a UK based music and culture movement in the mid 1990s which emphasised \"Britishness\", and produced brighter, catchier alternative rock, partly in reaction to the popularity of the darker lyrical themes of the US-led grunge music, an alternative rock genre, and to the UK's own shoegazing music scene.The most successful bands linked with the movement are Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp; those groups would come to be known as its \"big four\".The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993-1997, with 1994-1995, and a chart battle between Blur and Oasis dubbed \"The Battle of Britpop\", being the epicentre of activity.[6] While music was the main focus, fashion, art, and politics also got involved, with artists such as Damien Hirst being involved in creating videos for Blur, and being labelled as Britart or Britpop artists,and Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement.\nThough Britpop is viewed as a marketing tool, and more of a cultural moment than a musical style or genre,there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common, such as showing elements from the British pop music of the Sixties, glam rock and punk rock of the Seventies, and indie pop of the Eighties in their music. Britpop was a media driven focus on bands which emerged from the independent music scene of the early 1990s—and was associated with the British popular cultural movement of Cool Britannia which evoked the Swinging Sixties and the British guitar pop music of that decade.\nIn the wake of the musical invasion into the United Kingdom by American grunge bands, new British groups such as Blur and Suede launched the movement by positioning themselves as opposing musical forces, referencing British guitar music of the past and writing about uniquely British topics and concerns. These bands were soon joined by others including Oasis, Pulp, the Verve, Supergrass, Cast, Sleeper and Elastica.\n\nBritpop is a subgenre of alternative rock that originated in the United Kingdom. Britpop emerged from the British independent music scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands influenced by British guitar pop music of the 1960s and 1970s. The movement developed as a reaction against various musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly the grunge phenomenon from the United States.

Although its more popular bands were able to spread their commercial success overseas, especially to the United States, the movement largely fell apart by the end of the decade.","songs":[{"id":"xLoOEyb2a93","name":"Yellow","artist":"6e095c23"},{"id":"ck84ae64a6","name":"Somewhere Only We Know","artist":"Wfvd0def"},{"id":"b0xaE9eb29","name":"Patience","artist":"SNNb740e"},{"id":"fEMyQ41158","name":"Closer","artist":"T32d15f9"},{"id":"b4B1ca35a8","name":"Into The Fire","artist":"bwgHfad83"},{"id":"mQI1BI8f840","name":"Take Control","artist":"eGTA86eb6"},{"id":"xLq5nPbc0a8","name":"Fool's Day","artist":"SDY10585"},{"id":"Uo684c289","name":"Maybe Tomorrow","artist":"btE917a9e"},{"id":"d3a8M25c41","name":"Wonderwall","artist":"2IF5b4fe"},{"id":"L25A56c08","name":"Bitter Sweet Symphony","artist":"SO298145"},{"id":"b1xDoafd74","name":"Everything Will Flow","artist":"SN6e12a8"},{"id":"bqvzREC34e11","name":"前方","artist":"yhDswUaa63e"}],"albums":[{"id":"jPGpdf1d5","name":"Yellow","artist":"6e095c23"},{"id":"eTLH6bf8b","name":"Hopes and Fears","artist":"Wfvd0def"},{"id":"b5i2eaa56","name":"Beautiful World","artist":"SNNb740e"},{"id":"jgnYcdace","name":"Parachutes","artist":"6e095c23"},{"id":"f8p352e4f","name":"Closer","artist":"T32d15f9"},{"id":"eUeV8c87e","name":"A Rush of Blood to the Head","artist":"6e095c23"},{"id":"bffoad6f2","name":"Coming Up","artist":"SN6e12a8"},{"id":"be69cec17","name":"(What's the Story) Morning Glo...","artist":"2IF5b4fe"},{"id":"nsd8f840e","name":"X&Y","artist":"6e095c23"},{"id":"zloWbf75c8","name":"AM","artist":"6s976196"},{"id":"b5rke7527","name":"Urban Hymns","artist":"SO298145"},{"id":"fMxF5f857","name":"Fool's Day","artist":"SDY10585"}],"artists":[{"id":"6e095c23","name":"Coldplay"},{"id":"2J6912ec","name":"Radiohead"},{"id":"6fV69232","name":"Muse"},{"id":"2IF5b4fe","name":"Oasis"},{"id":"SN6e12a8","name":"Suede"},{"id":"SDY10585","name":"Blur"},{"id":"Wfvd0def","name":"Keane"},{"id":"T32d15f9","name":"Travis"},{"id":"bt4i17f2c","name":"Placebo"},{"id":"WENca5d1","name":"Snow Patrol"},{"id":"btE917a9e","name":"Stereophonics"},{"id":"SO298145","name":"The Verve"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1381","name":"迷幻摇滚 Psychedelic Rock","description":"迷幻摇滚（英文：Psychedelic rock）是一种摇滚乐流派，其源自迷幻文化及使用迷幻药而产生的思维骤变。迷幻摇滚涌现于1960年代的英美，与车库摇滚及民谣摇滚乐团属同一时期。迷幻摇滚介于早期以蓝调为基础的摇滚音乐，至前卫摇滚、艺术摇滚、实验摇滚、硬摇滚，甚至重金属间的过渡时期。迷幻摇滚同时并融入了非西方的音乐元素，如印度音乐的拉加（ragas）与西塔尔琴（sitars）。\n\n迷幻摇滚指受吸毒产生的幻觉体验激发而创作的摇滚音乐，通常可以和“Psychedelic Rock）一词通用。1966年，“第十三层电梯”（Thirteenth Floor Elevators）演唱组在奥斯丁出版了第一张专辑，旧金山的“杰弗逊飞机”（JEFFERSON AIRPLANE）乐队紧随其后，而“数五下”（Count Five）的《疯子的反应》（Psychotic Reaction）进入了排行榜前5名。电台DJ对此类音乐的大力宣传使歌手们深受鼓舞，竞相效尤，纷纷用大量模糊的电吉他声、反馈噪音、电子合成器声以及单纯的高分贝噪音充斥自己的作品，以此模拟想象中大麻和麦角酸酰二乙酸（LSD）带给人的种种放纵迷幻的感觉。\n\n盛行于60 年代中、后期，是嬉皮士运动的产物之一。其音乐特色是震耳欲聋的强烈节奏、尖厉响亮的电吉它单人或双人演奏。不同于重金属摇滚，迷幻摇滚没有一定的曲式，即兴演奏的成分较多，其无旋律的音调变化多端，常常富有精彩华妙的表现。“酸性”（acid) 一词是迷幻剂LSD的俚语代名词，酸性摇滚因为具有狂热的迷幻音乐特点，故有其名。代表乐手、乐队有：Jimi Hendrix、Jefferson Airplane、the beatles、the Doors、the Greatful Dead,Pink Floyd等。这些组合其歌迷都蓄长发、着彩色鲜艳的服装，持有反世俗的态度，这种外在表现与音乐一样重要。\n\nPsychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs. It often uses new recording techniques and effects and draws on non-Western sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.\n\nIt was pioneered by musicians including The Beatles, The Byrds, and The Yardbirds, emerging as a genre during the mid 1960s among folk rock and blues rock bands in the United Kingdom and United States, such as Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Cream, The Doors and Pink Floyd. It reached a peak in between 1967 and 1969 with the Summer of Love and Woodstock Rock Festival, becoming an international musical movement and associated with a widespread counter-culture, before beginning a decline as changing attitudes, the loss of some key individuals and a back-to-basics movement, led surviving performers to move into new musical areas.\n\nPsychedelic rock influenced the creation of psychedelic pop and psychedelic soul. It also bridged the transition from early blues- and folk music-based rock to progressive rock, glam rock, hard rock and as a result influenced the development of sub-genres such as heavy metal. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in various forms of neo-psychedelia.","songs":[{"id":"gosSa72e70","name":"Wish You Were Here","artist":"2Je62da1"},{"id":"cipG8ecb94","name":"Rain and

Post-Rock","description":"摇滚乐从20世纪中叶发展至今，想想也快近半个世纪了。然而摇滚乐到底是什么？或许到目前谁都还无法用任何的描述做一完整的定论；因为有人认为摇滚乐就是从当初的爵士、蓝调、民谣逐渐演化融合而成的混杂乐种；然而也有人认为摇滚乐当初就是禀着一种叛逆精神、生活态度或是一个观念而已。但不论如何，“Rock Music”在经过四十余年各种类型流派的萌芽与茁壮，才使得摇滚乐在今日得以呈现出这么多样的风格与类型出来。\n\nPost-Rock名词的出现与争议\n\n　　大约在95年，美国村声杂志刊载了一篇由英国乐评家西蒙·雷诺兹（Simon Reynolds）所写的文章，而文中，这位西蒙先生主要是企图想描绘出，在九十年代中期，一群以\"Drag City\"、\"Trill Jockey\"、\"Too Pure\"这几个厂牌为主的地下乐队的音乐，而他们不管是在乐风或观念上，主要是以酷派爵士（Cool Jazz）、即兴爵士（Free Jazz）、环境音乐 （Ambient）、雷鬼音乐的混音技术（Dub）再加上七十年代的前卫摇滚（ProgressiveRock）和Kraut-Rock等多重风格来做为他们在音乐创作实验的基本要素。而在此一大范畴下，恰好当时的芝加哥市、英美两国及欧洲各地，均有一堆当地的地下乐队符合西蒙先生的描述，而他在文中便首次以\"Post-Rock\"一词，暂时统称这些勇于突破现有摇滚乐定义的前卫团体。没想到，过没多久，一些音乐杂志便以\"Post-Rock\"来正式称呼这群致力于摇滚乐新美学的新生代乐队。\n　　不过后摇滚（Post-Rock）虽然已经先有了一个较为正式的称呼，但其实在最初的时候，许多音乐杂志对这一群人所玩的音乐基本上都还是无法做一定论。像是滚石杂志当初在介绍这些团体时，还只是用\"Instrument Rock\"一词来称呼他们，其原因主要是这些乐队大部分都较偏向纯乐器演奏而且也没有主唱。但有的刊物又因针对其乐风或渊源，于是有人又称之为\n　　\"DroneRock\"、\"Space Rock\"、\"Out Rock\"、\"Neo-shoegazer-rock\"或\"Kraut-Rock\"等各种名词。然而，\"后摇滚\"这个名称被正式采用，则还是后来英国《Wire》音乐杂志持续有系统的用\"Post- Rock\"一词做大幅度的介绍报导后，整个所谓的\"后摇滚运动\"才慢慢地传开来。只不过到现在为止，仍有许多乐评人或被贴上后摇滚乐队的团体都仍非常讨厌或否认\"后摇滚\"这一名词。因为他们认为这一名词卷标根本都不足以形容他们自己所玩的音乐风格；甚至被视为现今\"后摇滚\"大本营之一的芝加哥，在当初的时候，当地的另类音乐刊物或乐评也几乎不提\"后摇滚\"这个名词来形容当时刚崛起的代表乐队Tortoise或Sea And\n　　Cake。更甚者，许多乐评家还认为所谓\"后摇滚\"这个观念根本早在七十年代就已出现，只是这些观念还只是蕴含在各种非主流的乐派及几个关键性乐队中，而且那时出现的还都只是零散的创作概念构想，而现在只不过经由西蒙先生的一番介绍，才这样由媒体的运作，就俨然成为新一代的音乐种类?\n\nPost-Rock的基本概念\n\n　　那么到底当初西蒙先生的定义到底是怎么一回事？而所谓的\"后摇滚\"到底又是什么？它和所谓一般的\"摇滚乐\"又有何区别？如果说\"后摇滚\"音乐便如同\"后现代主义\"相对于\"现代主义\"的反动，那么它主要便是企图颠覆摇滚乐的基本概念与传统架构，或是甚至针对整个所谓音乐工业的运作做一消极的反抗。譬如说，同样是玩电吉他、鼓及贝斯的摇滚团体，但换到玩\"后摇滚\"的乐手中，却可能完全转变成另一种完全不同的创作观念。简略地说，所谓\"后摇滚\"其实就是一种由概念或理论去颠覆传统摇滚音乐创作的模式（如主旋律-桥段-主旋律-桥段）。而如果你听过一点\"后摇滚\"的音乐的话，你或许就会发现，他们所引用的理论则大都是援用所谓\"解构主义\"或西洋文学理论里头的\"后现代主义\"或者\"后结构主义\"的观念。也因此，就像十年前南辕北辙的\"解构主义\"作品一样，现在你若去找寻所有的 \"后摇滚\"乐队，那你可能会发觉他们听起来没有一个乐队是相近或相类似的风格（或许在他们的脑中，风格早已被 打破或不存在了）。\n　　所以，当初西蒙先生心里所想的定义应该是很广泛的，因为当94年芝加哥乐队Tortoise和Sea And Cake发表同名专辑时，这两张专辑便已呈现出两种颇为不同的风格：Tortoise深受七十年代前卫摇滚乐队Can及电子乐实验乐队Kraftwerk 的理念影响，但有的作品又直承现代音乐、极简主义（如Philip Glass）或是Free Jazz大师Miles Davis、Ornette Coleman 及Sun Ra的影响；至于Sea And Cake，则反而专注于营造漂浮低调的情感；甚至在\"后摇滚\"领域较为知名的Stereolab则是大量运用流行音乐的基调，然后再加以解构重组而成另一种风貌的。\n\n音乐特点\n\n　　在90年代兴起的深受电声器乐摇滚影响的实验摇滚运动中，后摇滚无疑是占有统治地位的音乐类型。后摇滚音乐中集结了一大堆实验流派－Krauft-Rock、氛围音乐（Ambient）、激进摇滚（Progressive Rock）、Space Rock、Math Rock、Tape Music、简约古典（Minimalist Classical）、British IDM, Jazz (both Avant-Garde and Cool), 和 Dub Reggae，一句话简言之就是：音乐大部分架构在摇滚音乐上，但是它实质上不是摇滚音乐。\n　　后摇滚给听众的音乐感受是与传统意义上的摇滚乐激励情感是完全相反的，它的音乐富于使人催眠和声响低沉单调（尤见于一些以吉他为主的乐队），即使相对亮色的音乐也使人感到镇定和醒脑。之所以如此是因为后摇滚当初就是反对摇滚的一种回应，尤其是当主流乐界对另类音乐的同化后更加如此，很多后摇滚乐队是在一个相同的意识下建立起来的，这种意识就是：摇滚乐已经丧失了自身的真正的反叛意识，并且很难从自身的陈旧模式和空洞姿态的窠穴中自拔。所以后摇滚拒绝一切与传统摇滚乐相关的东西。\n　　后摇滚音乐着力于纯粹声响和音色远甚于对旋律和歌曲结构的沉迷，其大部分作品倾向于器乐，即使作品中有人声出现，也仅仅是作为整体音乐效果的一种附属。\n　　后摇滚音乐基架的建立是在1991年两部竭然不同的里程碑作品的发表：Talk Talk乐队的《Laughing Stock》和Slint乐队的《Spiderland》。《Laughing Stock》是Talk Talk乐队从合成器流行乐转型后的顶峰之作，其音乐是对情境音乐（Ambient）、爵士乐（Jazz）以及简约室内乐（Minimalist Chamber Music）进行情绪化的、精巧的融合；而《Spiderland》的音乐则是充满深思的、bass-driven grooves、喃喃的诗化歌词、晦涩的结构以及极度的音量切换。这两部作品对很多后来的后摇滚乐队都产生过影响。\n　　后摇滚一词则是由评论家所创造的。Post Rock一词最初是由Simon Reynolds在描述Bark Psychosis受到Talk Talk乐队影响的氛围音乐实验时使用，结果该词被应用于称呼那些不曾归类的从勇于打破既定传统的乐队（如Gastr del Sol, Cul de Sac, Main）到像Stereolab, Laika和the Sea and Cake这样的Indie Rock乐队（注：这其中不包括Slint乐队的仿效者）。后摇滚被公众承认是在来自芝加哥的Tortoise乐队1996年发表的第二张专辑《Millions Now Living Will Never Die》之后，这部作品也许是后摇滚各种实验元素所达到的最极至的融合。这样，后摇滚瞬间就为评论界提供了区分各种此类型下不同乐队（艺人）及其前辈们的方法，之后后摇滚迅速成为了同时代的独立摇滚（Indie Rock）的堂兄弟，集中在Thrill Jockey, Kranky, Drag City, 和Too Pure这些厂牌之下。\n　　具有讽刺意味的是在90年代末，后摇滚获得了千篇一律的名声，一些人发现这种音乐缺乏感情令人生厌，另一些人认为后摇滚已经没有了当初的激进融合而变得众所周知，这其中部分原因应归咎于许多后摇滚乐队在他们的最初音乐理念上甚少变化。然而即使在这种倒退的情况下，新一轮的乐队（the Dirty Three, Rachel's, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Sigur Ros）以其独特的声音获得了较为广泛的赞许，暗示着后摇滚这种音乐类型毕竟还未走到尽头。\n\nPost-rock was the dominant form of experimental rock during the '90s, a loose movement that drew from greatly varied influences and nearly always combined standard rock instrumentation with electronics. Post-rock brought together a host of mostly experimental genres -- Kraut-rock, ambient, prog-rock, space rock, math rock, tape music, minimalist classical, British IDM, jazz (both avant-garde and cool), and dub reggae, to name the most prevalent -- with results that were largely based in rock, but didn't rock per se. Post-rock was hypnotic and often droning (especially the guitar-oriented bands), and the brighter-sounding groups were still cool and cerebral -- overall, the antithesis of rock's visceral power. In fact, post-rock was something of a reaction against rock, particularly the mainstream's co-opting of alternative rock; much post-rock was united by a sense that rock & roll had lost its capacity for real rebellion, that it would never break away from tired formulas or empty, macho posturing. Thus, post-rock rejected (or subverted) any elements it associated with rock tradition. It was far more concerned with pure sound and texture than melodic hooks or song structure; it was also usually instrumental, and if it did employ vocals, they were often incidental to the overall effect. The musical foundation for post-rock crystallized in 1991, with the release of two very different landmarks: Talk Talk's Laughing Stock and Slint's Spiderland. Laughing Stock was the culmination of Talk Talk's move away from synth-pop toward a moody, delicate fusion of ambient, jazz, and minimalist chamber music; Spiderland, meanwhile, was full of deliberate, bass-driven grooves, mumbled poetry, oblique structures, and extreme volume shifts. While those two albums would influence many future post-rock bands, the term itself didn't appear until critic Simon Reynolds coined it as a way to describe the Talk Talk-inspired ambient experiments of Bark Psychosis. The term was later applied to everything from unclassifiable iconoclasts (Gastr del Sol, Cul de Sac, Main) to more tuneful indie-rock experimenters like Stereolab, Laika, and the Sea and Cake (not to mention a raft of Slint imitators). Post-rock came into its own as a recognizable trend with the Chicago band Tortoise's second album, 1996's Millions Now Living Will Never Die, perhaps the farthest-reaching fusion of post-rock's myriad touchstones. Suddenly there was a way for critics to classify artists as diverse as Labradford, Trans Am, Ui, Flying Saucer Attack, Mogwai, Jim O'Rourke, and their predecessors (though most hated the label). Post-rock quickly became an accepted, challenging cousin of indie rock, centered around the Thrill Jockey, Kranky, Drag City, and Too Pure labels. Ironically, by the end of the decade, post-rock had itself acquired a reputation for sameness; some found the style's dispassionate intellectuality boring, while others felt that its formerly radical fusions had become predictable, partly because many artists were offering only slight variations on their original ideas. However, even as the backlash set in, a newer wave of bands (the Dirty Three, Rachel's, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Sigur Rós) gained wider recognition for their distinctive sounds, suggesting that the style wasn't exhausted after all.","songs":[{"id":"xLr5kga5b48","name":"UK Jamaican","artist":"Tsuddd48"},{"id":"cWzxl21489","name":"Mariana","artist":"ES16f646"},{"id":"go2y343e5a","name":"It's Dark, It's Cold, It's Winter","artist":"Wo3107e4"},{"id":"OEgF8eda6","name":"Forever Lost","artist":"WfWd79cc"},{"id":"OK6r80a14","name":"All Alright","artist":"33w60621"},{"id":"bqvktue38d2f","name":"III","artist":"iRwfcab38"},{"id":"xL2AuRd70d7","name":"暖冬","artist":"FQE4e879"},{"id":"fCzXt438a8","name":"Quiet","artist":"d8tm3cece"},{"id":"b9WhVbe694","name":"Anything You Synthesize ","artist":"6oc7d1a1"},{"id":"bAompd2588","name":"He Films the Clouds, Pt. 2","artist":"beEwb9702"},{"id":"ckL4De56e8","name":"污水塘 ","artist":"ga8d309c"},{"id":"OHQo79bf9","name":"Hi","artist":"d2oc6acaa"}],"albums":[{"id":"vHcT2acb0","name":"In Today Already Walks Tomorro...","artist":"Wo3107e4"},{"id":"f5Eo66a7a","name":"Yui","artist":"ES16f646"},{"id":"kdFMb8b1e","name":"Mixed Race","artist":"Tsuddd48"},{"id":"8qPB40f66","name":"All Is Violent, All Is Bright","artist":"WfWd79cc"},{"id":"oMNEe26b1","name":"Who You Are Is Not Enough","artist":"iRwfcab38"},{"id":"eUo28782e","name":"The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead P...","artist":"d2qr3d5ab"},{"id":"ftSd918d2","name":"Young Mountain","artist":"d8tm3cece"},{"id":"jgUlcf69a","name":"IV","artist":"ga8d309c"},{"id":"ns9Ted0e5","name":"Með Suð Í Eyrum Við Spilum End...","artist":"33w60621"},{"id":"xhI3wza8a6a","name":"遥远的某处","artist":"FQE4e879"},{"id":"jYPtb1b77","name":"Tempus Fugit","artist":"bjp5140c0"},{"id":"1iqv3061c","name":"散落的时光","artist":"bAZPec23e"}],"artists":[{"id":"ga8d309c","name":"惘闻"},{"id":"33w60621","name":"Sigur Rós"},{"id":"gZU9f3a0","name":"MONO"},{"id":"T4ea3054","name":"Mogwai"},{"id":"d2qr3d5ab","name":"Explosions In The Sky"},{"id":"WfWd79cc","name":"God Is An Astronaut"},{"id":"baBPc8bee","name":"world's end girlfriend"},{"id":"cy3LdRb625b","name":"TK from 凛として時雨"},{"id":"dyW94c7f","name":"甜梅號"},{"id":"6lI644d8","name":"pg.lost"},{"id":"ES16f646","name":"Childs"},{"id":"ZZIb1f39","name":"toe"}]},{"type":"style","id":"275","name":"硬摇滚 Hard Rock","description":"硬摇滚（英语：hard rock），或称重摇滚（heavy rock），是一种摇滚乐流派，最早发源于1960年代中期的油渍摇滚与迷幻摇滚，比以往的摇滚乐更为猛烈。硬式摇滚主要使用失真效果的电吉他、贝斯、鼓及钢琴等键盘乐器。\n最早的摇滚乐队如ROLLING STONES，The WHO，BLOOD SWEAT; TEAR等，以及后来的LED ZEPPELIN，AC/DC，kiss乐队，CHEAP TRICK,Guns N' Roses等可以说是硬摇滚乐队。\n\nHard rock is a term that's frequently applied to any sort of loud, aggressive guitar rock, but for these purposes, the definition is more specific. To be sure, hard rock is loud, aggressive guitar rock, but it isn't as heavy as heavy metal, and it's only very rarely influenced by punk (though it helped inspire punk). Hard rock generally prizes big, stadium-ready guitar riffs, anthemic choruses, and stomping, swaggering backbeats; its goals are usually (though not universally) commercial, and it's nearly always saturated with machismo. With some bands, it can be difficult to tell where the dividing line between hard rock and heavy metal falls, but the basic distinction is that ever since Black Sabbath, metal tends to be darker and more menacing, while hard rock (for the most part) has remained exuberant, chest-thumping party music. \n\nAdditionally, while metal riffs often function as stand-alone melodies, hard rock riffs tend to outline chord progressions in their hooks, making for looser, more elastic jams should the band decide to stretch out instrumentally. Like heavy metal, hard rock sprang from the mid-'60s intersection of blues-rock and psychedelia pioneered by artists like Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and the Jeff Beck Group. Blues-rock and psychedelia were both exploring the limits of electric amplification, and blues-rock was pushing the repeated guitar riff center stage, while taking some of the swing out of the blues beat and replacing it with a thumping power. Hard rock really came into its own at the dawn of the '70s, with the tough, boozy rock of the Rolling Stones (post-Brian Jones) and Faces, the blues-drenched power and textured arrangements of Led Zeppelin, the post-psychedelic rave-ups of Deep Purple, and the loud, ringing power chords of the Who (circa Who's Next) setting the template for much of what followed. Later in the decade, the lean, stripped-down riffs of AC/DC and Aerosmith, the catchy tunes and stage theatrics of Alice Cooper and Kiss, and the instrumental flash of Van Halen set new trends, though the essential musical blueprint for hard rock remained similar. Arena rock also became a dominant force, stripping out nearly all blues influence and concentrating solely on big, bombastic hooks. During the '80s, hard rock was dominated by glossy pop-metal, although Guns N' Roses, the Black Crowes, and several others did present a grittier, more traditionalist alternative. Old-fashioned hard rock became a scarce commodity in the post-alternative rock era; after grunge, many guitar bands not only adopted a self-consciously serious attitude, but also resisted the urge to write fist-pumping, arena-ready choruses. Still, the '90s did produce a few exceptions, such as Oasis, Urge Overkill, and the serious but anthemic Pearl Jam.","songs":[{"id":"cMdXE20b1a","name":"It's My Life","artist":"SEbc4cce"},{"id":"fO7s7a822","name":"无地自容","artist":"fV899886"},{"id":"bAXZZ13874","name":"We Will Rock You","artist":"2J26523c"},{"id":"d2iNl26378","name":"Don't Cry (Original Version)","artist":"2FZ81622"},{"id":"b7sesa3f14","name":"She's Gone","artist":"bQn7222c3"},{"id":"r8Th1e2e5","name":"镜子中","artist":"fYabb37c"},{"id":"b1wEN9b70b","name":"Sailing","artist":"SNue0f04"},{"id":"cgjAYe40e8","name":"Long Long Way to Go","artist":"bsGse2360"},{"id":"b0CxB9ae6c","name":"Stairway to Heaven","artist":"SIgc5d19"},{"id":"d3a8M25c41","name":"Wonderwall","artist":"2IF5b4fe"},{"id":"cMuoa238e2","name":"Fade to Black","artist":"SIPde690"},{"id":"bf0r55v318fa","name":"Still Loving You","artist":"SLhaf8d6"}],"albums":[{"id":"d48B41cdf","name":"黑豹 同名专辑","artist":"fV899886"},{"id":"bdnmb4cc4","name":"Crush","artist":"SEbc4cce"},{"id":"djYd38977","name":"Use Your Illusion I","artist":"2FZ81622"},{"id":"f7YZ5e06b","name":"Queen Rocks","artist":"2J26523c"},{"id":"DSE5f297","name":"Use Your Illusion II","artist":"2FZ81622"},{"id":"djYa3751c","name":"Appetite for Destruction","artist":"2FZ81622"},{"id":"beFS14118","name":"A Night at the Opera","artist":"2J26523c"},{"id":"be69cec17","name":"(What's the Story) Morning Glo...","artist":"2IF5b4fe"},{"id":"eTJY59980","name":"The Wall","artist":"2Je62da1"},{"id":"beyeb8d61","name":"Metallica","artist":"SIPde690"},{"id":"zloWbf75c8","name":"AM","artist":"6s976196"},{"id":"n9bVe70fc","name":"Steelheart","artist":"bQn7222c3"}],"artists":[{"id":"2FZ81622","name":"Guns N' Roses"},{"id":"2J26523c","name":"Queen"},{"id":"SIPde690","name":"Metallica"},{"id":"LPva27d5","name":"丝绒公路"},{"id":"SEbc4cce","name":"Bon Jovi"},{"id":"2Dm503c2","name":"David Bowie"},{"id":"SIgc5d19","name":"Led Zeppelin"},{"id":"SDib8104","name":"AC/DC"},{"id":"SEIbc3e7","name":"Eric Clapton"},{"id":"2JV625ce","name":"The Rolling Stones"},{"id":"SLhaf8d6","name":"Scorpions"},{"id":"bsGE2dc33","name":"The Doors"}]},{"type":"style","id":"956","name":"新迷幻 Neo-Psychedelia","description":"新迷幻包括了一大批从后朋克时期一直到现在的不同类型的艺人们，他们都来源于60年代的形式各异的迷幻音乐。不管他们是表演引起幻觉的迷幻流行（如 the Beatles，早期的 Pink Floyd，和数不清的其他乐队）、受 Byrds 影响的嘈杂的吉他摇滚、充满失真的形式自由的即兴演奏、或者让人神经混乱的音速试验，也不管他们的音乐是已经现代化了的还是完全厚着脸皮照搬最开始的那些艺人的，他们唤起性的异乎寻常的声音都是引起人们幻觉的源泉。有一些新迷幻很明显是吸毒后的产物，而其他的一些则逻辑上是把毒品作为他们怪异的歌词与激进的装扮的补充。新迷幻偶尔也会打入流行音乐的主流中，比如 Prince 80年代中期的作品和90年代 Lenny Kravitz 一些崇尚复兴的作品；但在很大程度上，它还是另类与独立摇滚乐队的领地。\n\n新迷幻最初是在70年代末期英国的后朋克背景下出现的，主要的乐队包括 the Teardrop Explodes, Echo & the Bunnymen, 以及 the Soft Boys； 但是除了80年代早期的佩斯利地下运动（Paisley Underground movement）与90年代末期的六大象团体（Elephant 6 collective），大部分后来的新迷幻都来自单独的行为乖张的人士或复兴运动者，而不是以上的背景。其中最著名的包括空幻的澳大利亚金属乐队 the Church，将美妙的旋律、诗一般的歌词与强大有力的三重奏干扰混合在一起的 Nick Salomans Bevis Frond，声音低沉单调的笼罩着吸毒者阴霾的 Spacemen 3，风格诡异的前温和派学院摇滚 Boy Robyn Hitch***，全然不可思议的 Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips，以及电子英伦流行乐队Wales Super Furry Animals。\n\n60年代中期，迷幻是一种隐秘的音乐元素，如许多的隐秘元素一样，它最终浮出水面。自bealtles创作出具有该风格的乐曲1966s Revolver之后，迷幻元素的出现就成为指日可待的事情。大体上说，纯迷幻音乐与其他音乐风格迥然不同，而迷幻流行则在揉和迷幻元素的基础上创造了一种简单明快，琅琅上口的流行音乐曲风。在歌曲结构和旋律都基本固定的音乐里，迷幻效果只作为装饰而存在----锡塔尔琴，轻柔的吉他乐，合成效果，背景吉他乐，甚至Beach Boys风格混合在一起，创造出一种程度适当的迷幻感觉。有一度迷幻流行音乐都是在录音室里制成的，但其实仍然有许多正规的乐队如迷幻风格相当的凸现流畅Sagetterius；这些乐队都明显地受了Beach Boys风格的影响，但并不像Lemon Pipers的Green Tambourine那样单薄。因为音乐中有更为强烈的流行感，迷幻流行音乐比纯迷幻音乐具有更长久的活力，一直到70年代早期依然兴盛不衰。更为让人惊讶的是，部分迷幻流行乐比普通迷幻乐更具吸引力，因为迷幻流行乐飘忽诡异，偶尔兼有迷幻和流行的双重元素----1969年the Neon Philharmonics的专辑The Moth Confesses是其主要代表作品。\n\nNeo-psychedelia is music that emulates or is heavily influenced by the psychedelic music of the 1960s. It began to be revived among British post-punk bands of the later 1970s and early 1980s and was taken up by groups including bands of the Paisley Underground and Madchester scenes, as well as occasional interest from mainstream artists and bands into the new millennium.","songs":[{"id":"L25A56c08","name":"Bitter Sweet Symphony","artist":"SO298145"},{"id":"dCyn62a7cd","name":"Flowers in December","artist":"bt0xefd3a"},{"id":"8G4bk0f0dad","name":"My Jinji","artist":"elB2456da"},{"id":"UoUO1075b","name":"Agoraphobia","artist":"bwoUe802c"},{"id":"ckBuJf0bed","name":"1979","artist":"SMGde714"},{"id":"mQAl817977e","name":"Into Black","artist":"bpS2bc748"},{"id":"UaY96ae78","name":"Made of Stone","artist":"2M495973"},{"id":"xLA9iY9cbfa","name":"Yes I'm Changing","artist":"b90Ff35c6"},{"id":"mQXPhM78e37","name":"Kokopelli","artist":"URUtDA281e1"},{"id":"d2r632ce6a","name":"Goddess On A Highway","artist":"bsJHe4ce3"},{"id":"Lxv17885f","name":"Lay It Down Slow","artist":"2Mn77ca5"},{"id":"bqvfUIf3a375","name":"Lovers (Casa del Mirto Remix)","artist":"bBvc185fa"}],"albums":[{"id":"b5rke7527","name":"Urban Hymns","artist":"SO298145"},{"id":"yhETJ1dd7a1","name":"Jinji Kikko","artist":"elB2456da"},{"id":"nUcy193ba","name":"Flowers in December","artist":"bt0xefd3a"},{"id":"mjk2wD6746a","name":"Currents","artist":"b90Ff35c6"},{"id":"Ddw54a18c","name":"Microcastle","artist":"bwoUe802c"},{"id":"9czQbsf1470","name":"Skiptracing","artist":"URUtDA281e1"},{"id":"EU7cdd9a","name":"Mellon Collie and the Infinite...","artist":"SMGde714"},{"id":"FcY8b9a1","name":"The Stone Roses","artist":"2M495973"},{"id":"yhEz6ua30b1","name":"1997-2015 DEMO COLLECTION","artist":"8vNxzXf4cfe"},{"id":"nbnJff7ae","name":"Among My Swan","artist":"bt0xefd3a"},{"id":"glD49065d","name":"Blouse","artist":"bpS2bc748"},{"id":"sTjo2478f","name":"Sun Fun Gun","artist":"ueW3af83"}],"artists":[{"id":"bt0xefd3a","name":"Mazzy Star"},{"id":"SO298145","name":"The Verve"},{"id":"SMGde714","name":"The Smashing Pumpkins"},{"id":"WsMd3b63","name":"MGMT"},{"id":"mvhwQc5aa49","name":"詹盼"},{"id":"2M495973","name":"The Stone Roses"},{"id":"bwoUe802c","name":"Deerhunter"},{"id":"bwmAf8c93","name":"Black Rebel Motorcycle Club"},{"id":"m23Crb61515","name":"Gatsby in a Daze"},{"id":"b90Ff35c6","name":"Tame Impala"},{"id":"bfZ4dc336","name":"Tycho"},{"id":"WM2aa5d0","name":"Kasabian"}]},{"type":"style","id":"247","name":"噪音摇滚 Noise Rock","description":"噪音摇滚是另类/独立摇滚的一个分属流派，正如它的名字所说的那样，它是被包裹在充满反馈、不和谐与磨损的尖利的吉他拂动中的摇滚乐。它占据了一个处于泡泡糖摇滚舞曲与先锋派音乐中间的位置，是传统的音乐创作方式与白色噪音的音速袭击相碰撞的产物。\n\n噪音摇滚派生于朋克摇滚，尤其是指那些用令人耳眩纷乱的电吉他声来表达年轻人焦虑和自负的朋克音乐。Noise Rock就像它的前辈“无浪潮”（No Wave）一样，其目的就是要让音乐更加碾磨化并以此达到一种滑稽讽刺效果或是表明一种立场、声明，而其音乐则总是诉诸于纯粹的声响能量。\n\n尽管大部分Noise Rock乐队的音乐注意力是集中在由电吉他失真所产生的脱粒般的声响（有时这些乐队也会使用一些电子仪器来作为打击乐器或是增强音乐整体的不谐和），但仍有部分乐队更加关注于声响和歌曲结构的融合，如先驱乐队Sonic Youth当把音乐的富于旋律和其单调低沉的噪音相结合时，无疑将Noise Rock带入了更为宽广的另类音乐听众中。\n\nSonic Youth带来了一群模仿者，但这其中并不是所有的乐队音乐都像它，如80年代的The Swan和Big Black的音乐就有更为黑暗、阴森的倾向，而当时的Touch&Go厂牌在80年代末成为这种风格的音乐的中心；再如90年代Noise Rock衍生出一些戏剧性的分支类型，这些分支经常会被诸如“邋遢摇滚”（scuzz-rock）这样的词汇所形容，这种风格的音乐是用吉他噪音营造出一种肮脏、颓废、令人厌恶的声场（如Royal Trux, Pussy Galore, the Dwarves和 the Butthole Surfers）。\n\nNoise-Rock is an outgrowth of punk rock, specifically the sort of punk that expressed youthful angst and exuberance through the glorious racket of amateurishly played electric guitars. Noise-rock, like its forerunner no wave, aims to be more abrasive, sometimes for comic effect and sometimes to make a statement, but always concentrating on the sheer power of the sound. While most noise-rock bands concentrate on the ear-shattering sounds that can be produced by distorted electric guitars, some also use electronic instrumentation, whether as percussion or to add to the overall cacophony. Some groups are more concerned than others about integrating their sonic explorations into song structures; pioneers Sonic Youth helped bring noise-rock to a wider alternative-rock audience when they began to incorporate melody into their droning sheets of sound. Sonic Youth produced a bevy of imitators, but not all noise-rock resembles their music -- '80s bands like the Swans and Big Black took a much darker, more threatening approach, and the Touch & Go label became a center for crazed, shock-oriented takes on the style in the late '80s and '90s. A certain theatrical sub-style of noise-rock, often described as \"scuzz-rock\" or with similar terms, uses the guitar noise to help create a dirty, decadent, repulsive atmosphere (bands like this include Royal Trux, Pussy Galore, the Dwarves, and the Butthole Surfers).","songs":[{"id":"xLqgXYe104b","name":"Beat the Devil's Tattoo","artist":"bwmAf8c93"},{"id":"cWgJW36420","name":"Superstar (selected by Diablo Cody) ","artist":"SMRc7c8d"},{"id":"b1Nawbe0c8","name":"For the Damaged Coda","artist":"bt5Sfb49b"},{"id":"mQIenC55818","name":"围城","artist":"jFLf7948"},{"id":"bf0yxCC33915","name":"亲爱的，我想做你女朋友","artist":"ueW3af83"},{"id":"ONz98263b","name":"The Man Who Sold The World","artist":"2Dm503c2"},{"id":"xN6z1ucd9e9","name":"游荡者","artist":"yhDqAif9592"},{"id":"Pcnl7d11d","name":"Summer Dream (Amherst 2004)","artist":"W5Yb9931"},{"id":"xLvZpIb62f7","name":"喜鹊","artist":"GI1d66e9"},{"id":"JC9aoA2449c","name":"火烛","artist":"Oip67ec1"},{"id":"b6BZdc684c","name":"Over and Over","artist":"bznjf0084"},{"id":"cg63re7021","name":"Because of You","artist":"3wT62ba0"}],"albums":[{"id":"fKpJ845ec","name":"Beat The Devil's Tattoo","artist":"bwmAf8c93"},{"id":"8qIt408dd","name":"你知道东方在哪一边","artist":"s7Q3be4f"},{"id":"sTjo2478f","name":"Sun Fun Gun","artist":"ueW3af83"},{"id":"f4jKaf42c","name":"Hits Are For Squares","artist":"SMRc7c8d"},{"id":"nca5e36e6","name":"Melody of Certain Damaged Lemo...","artist":"bt5Sfb49b"},{"id":"8HrzS3f2a6f","name":"3","artist":"jFLf7948"},{"id":"EW863c73","name":"Sonic Nurse","artist":"SMRc7c8d"},{"id":"jgFad2fbe","name":"Kurt Cobain: About a Son (Musi...","artist":"WeU99a9d"},{"id":"beXqd7a83","name":"Daydream Nation","artist":"SMRc7c8d"},{"id":"nnhJZR698f9","name":"穿过公园就到了","artist":"yhDqAif9592"},{"id":"dBcU3f0c2","name":"Rather Ripped","artist":"SMRc7c8d"},{"id":"gqgH6fc6d","name":"Birdstriking","artist":"GI1d66e9"}],"artists":[{"id":"jFLf7948","name":"Carsick Cars"},{"id":"SMRc7c8d","name":"Sonic Youth"},{"id":"bt5Sfb49b","name":"Blonde Redhead"},{"id":"dyOF4359f","name":"My Bloody Valentine"},{"id":"bwoUe802c","name":"Deerhunter"},{"id":"mt4wj75a500","name":"梅卡德尔"},{"id":"b91xfba8e","name":"Mary See the Future"},{"id":"3z25fa37","name":"Swans"},{"id":"GI1d66e9","name":"鸟撞"},{"id":"bsHpfbbde","name":"The Flaming Lips"},{"id":"W80b6980","name":"Boris"},{"id":"SKrafed1","name":"Public Image Ltd."}]},{"type":"style","id":"1338","name":"垃圾摇滚 Grunge","description":"Grunge 或称Grunge Rock，中文名称为垃圾摇滚，邋遢摇滚，或油渍摇滚。是摇滚乐的一种风格形式。在即将进入21世纪之时，回顾一下这十年摇滚乐的发展史，会发现有一种音乐形式十分抢眼，这种音乐形式叫做GRUNGE。据说人们把从汽车里漏出的汽油与泥土形成得混合物叫GRUNGE。以此命名这种音乐形式，应该就是为了描述这种音乐的那种嘈杂而失真的感觉。由于在音乐上采用源于the Stooges 和 Black Sabbath这样乐队的泥泞黑暗的声响，Grunge实际上是重金属（heavy metal）和朋克（Punk）的混血儿。\n\n不少的GRUNGE乐队都称自己玩得是PUNK，其实GRUNGE和PUNK之间的确有共同点，可以说GRUNGE是PUNK在90年代的一种表现形式。虽然GRUNGE的走红是在90年代，但早在80年代中期GRUNGE ROCK就已出现，Melvins、Green River、Mother Love Bone都是GRUNGE ROCK的奠基人。当时这类乐队使用的乐器、录音器材都比较简陋，乐手们的技巧也比较粗糙。原因主要是这类乐队主要来自社会底层，没有经过更专业的训练也缺乏资金，而且他们也没有宏图大志成为摇滚明星。从这可以发现GRUNGE和PUNK是多么的相似。从歌词内容上看，同PUNK相似，GRUNGE也多是描写社会阴暗面的，以愤怒、讽刺、抨击或是无奈的态度来表达自己的感情。歌词也基本上没什么艺术可言，有时甚至是脏话连篇，不过这也不是绝对的。从音乐形式上看，GRUNGE的编曲较简单，用一些简单的和弦作为伴奏的主体。同是火爆狂躁，但与重金属还有明显的区别。首先GRUNGE的鼓点又快又狠但变化不多；其次歌手的嗓音并不华丽；还有，GRUNGE吉他SOLO比较失真，而重金属则不同。最后这个区别比较明显，不过这些也不是绝对的。西雅图既是GRUNGE发源地又是其大本营，所以GRUNGE乐队多来自西雅图也是一大特点。\n\n垃圾摇滚音乐的风格可以大体概括为“很脏”的吉他，强烈的反复演奏段落和重型鼓声。乐手们通过对标准朋克演奏方式的个性化和大量的运用吉他失真和回馈效果达到使声音“变脏”的目的。和朋克不同的是，垃圾摇滚音乐的节拍稍慢但却拥有一种不对称的和谐性。歌词方面，呈现出了一种典型的极端焦虑状态，作品大多表现了愤怒，挫折感，厌倦，悲伤，恐惧以及消沉的情绪。这些情绪的来源可能是普遍出现的青春期的叛逆性，这和很多垃圾摇滚乐手在青少年或青年期就开始音乐生涯不无关系。事实上，其他一些因素诸如贫困，对世俗偏见的反感以及对社会本质的清醒认识都会影响到垃圾摇滚音乐家的词曲创作。总而言之，不是所有的垃圾摇滚音乐都会涉及到这些强烈的情绪，比如涅槃乐队（Nirvana）具有嘲讽意味的作品《In Bloom》就很显著的运用了诙谐幽默的写作方式。其实其他的许多垃圾摇滚音乐也多少具备一些幽默的风格，只不过被大众媒体所忽视了。在20世纪80年代，垃圾摇滚音乐多含有对重金属以及其他摇滚音乐形式的讽刺。\n\nGrunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a genre of music originating in Seattle that lasted from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s. It is a sub-genre of alternative rock that emerged as a fusion of punk, alternative, and heavy metal.Inspired by hardcore punk, metal, and indie rock, grunge is generally characterized by heavily distorted electric guitars and contrasting song dynamics, and the grunge aesthetic is stripped-down compared to other forms of rock music. Lyrics are typically angst-filled, often addressing themes such as social alienation, apathy, frustration, sadness, fear, and depression.\nThe early grunge movement coalesced around Seattle independent record label Sub Pop in the late 1980s. Grunge became commercially successful in the first half of the 1990s, due mainly to the release of Nirvana's Nevermind and Pearl Jam's Ten. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of hard rock music at the time.However, many grunge bands were uncomfortable with this popularity. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, their influence continues to affect modern rock music.","songs":[{"id":"b1hrgd6b0c","name":"Smells Like Teen Spirit","artist":"2I876eb9"},{"id":"ckBuJf0bed","name":"1979","artist":"SMGde714"},{"id":"cgonMf8413","name":"Oh My Lover","artist":"2Gi6e197"},{"id":"bA24zdd5b3","name":"Last Kiss","artist":"ciM8280c3"},{"id":"xLq4ABaa181","name":"Nobody's Daughter","artist":"c8KN4ab3c"},{"id":"mSe7rW83c2d","name":"愛人同志","artist":"nmS0Lw70622"},{"id":"8HSbB2fddcb","name":"Voices","artist":"yiuj0Ua3f1c"},{"id":"ONz98263b","name":"The Man Who Sold The World","artist":"2Dm503c2"},{"id":"K3Pu745c2","name":"Black Hole Sun","artist":"SMU9a4b5"},{"id":"Uf5W672fb","name":"Knockin' on Heaven's Door (Live Recorded in Dublin)","artist":"cmjk2cad8"},{"id":"xLt4OQbfa3d","name":"The Regulator","artist":"4py91ba0"},{"id":"xLF5ccd62e7","name":"乌鸦","artist":"bf42aacce"}],"albums":[{"id":"bU7t23af2","name":"Nevermind","artist":"2I876eb9"},{"id":"be57a86a5","name":"MTV Unplugged in New York","artist":"2I876eb9"},{"id":"nnc1CY59dfa","name":"時代在召喚","artist":"nmS0Lw70622"},{"id":"EU7cdd9a","name":"Mellon Collie and the Infinite...","artist":"SMGde714"},{"id":"eUmI781ea","name":"Nirvana","artist":"2I876eb9"},{"id":"be569803e","name":"In Utero","artist":"2I876eb9"},{"id":"E4A517cf","name":"Bleach","artist":"2I876eb9"},{"id":"beV0c7410","name":"Siamese Dream","artist":"SMGde714"},{"id":"yhPvgh9ba93","name":"Voices","artist":"yiuj0Ua3f1c"},{"id":"kghScd0ae","name":"Icon","artist":"2I876eb9"},{"id":"fMu367d27","name":"Nobody's Daughter","artist":"c8KN4ab3c"},{"id":"jgFad2fbe","name":"Kurt Cobain: About a Son (Musi...","artist":"WeU99a9d"}],"artists":[{"id":"2I876eb9","name":"Nirvana"},{"id":"SMGde714","name":"The Smashing Pumpkins"},{"id":"2Gi6e197","name":"PJ Harvey"},{"id":"3xNcc804","name":"Foo Fighters"},{"id":"nmS0Lw70622","name":"假假條"},{"id":"E5Zd3786","name":"Kurt Cobain"},{"id":"ciM8280c3","name":"Pearl Jam"},{"id":"2Cq5d02b","name":"Alice in Chains"},{"id":"c8KN4ab3c","name":"Hole"},{"id":"yhD2wCb3ae5","name":"DYGL"},{"id":"SMU9a4b5","name":"Soundgarden"},{"id":"c8LE52767","name":"L7"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1385","name":"低保真 Lo-Fi","description":"在80年代初90年代末的时候，低保真已经不再只是对某张特定专辑录音质量的描述，它本身就成为了一种流派。贯穿整个摇滚史，唱片的录制往往都是在不合规格的设备上廉价而迅速地完成的。从这个意义上讲，那些最早的摇滚唱片、60年代绝大部分的车库摇滚和70年代后期许多的朋克摇滚都可以贴上低保真的标签。然而后来，低保真谈及的是搞地下独立摇滚的一类音乐人，他们用四轨的仪器在家录制其音乐素材。大部分这种音乐发源于80年代的美国地下，包括像R.E.M这样的乐队；另外还包括一批英国的原型朋克乐队和新西兰的乐队，比如the Chills 和 the Clean. 通常，这些低保真乐队会从简单的流行摇滚歌曲波动到自由形态的歌曲结构或纯粹的噪音与艺术性的实验音乐。尽管这些乐队保持了音乐的相对简单易与直接，但唱片质量低下的灌制、磁带涂层的声音失真与嘶嘶作响、以及抽象而愚钝的歌词依然使得他们的音乐声音显得不寻常而激进。最开始的时候，低保真的唱片都以自制磁带的方式进行交易，但也有一些独立的厂牌发布了正式的专辑，最著名的就是由Calvin Johnson经营的，领导了Beat Happening乐队的K Records.80年代末期，一些像Pussy Galore, Beat Happening 和 Royal Trux这样的乐队，在美国地下拥有了一小批狂热的追随者。到1992年，像Sebadoh 和 Pavement 这样的乐队已经通过他们蓄意做出的嘈杂而混乱的唱片成为在英美大受欢迎的崇拜偶像。几年之后，这种低保真美学在Liz Phair 和 Beck的帮助下以一种改进过的更加新型的式样侵占了主流市场。\n\nLo-fi (from the term \"low fidelity\") is lower quality of sound recordings than the usual standard for music. The qualities of lo-fi are usually achieved by either degrading the quality of the recorded audio, or using certain equipment. Recent uses of the phrase have led to it becoming a genre, although it still remains as an aesthetic in music recording practice. Many lo-fi artists use inexpensive cassette tape recorders. The term was adopted by WFMU DJ William Berger who dedicated a half hour segment of his program to home recorded music throughout the late '80s under the name lo-fi.","songs":[{"id":"NSFS8baea","name":"Between the Bars","artist":"31c84046"},{"id":"ckCSjfc1b4","name":"Orange Sky","artist":"6hP8b952"},{"id":"b1oiCa55cf","name":"Homecoming Queen","artist":"c93R2e8d6"},{"id":"goydD4847d","name":"Beautiful Boyz","artist":"Wjea7e6f"},{"id":"b5gBB97f38","name":"Boo","artist":"cCM22deda"},{"id":"bf00ZyL34a60","name":"Song for Zula","artist":"b4Zxed2e4"},{"id":"xLs4Sgc6a22","name":"Shook Down","artist":"blWNad679"},{"id":"clq3u1baeb","name":"Beautiful Day","artist":"7fP58f1b"},{"id":"PljE88a53","name":"Beautiful Rainbow","artist":"WNGc1b9c"},{"id":"b0E3L16464","name":"Exactly Where We're From","artist":"30P60d51"},{"id":"OcoH7c99a","name":"New Slang","artist":"4e89216b"},{"id":"cgfFWe9af5","name":"Loser","artist":"SDDd9344"}],"albums":[{"id":"eDxs8b6b5","name":"Either/Or","artist":"31c84046"},{"id":"kjluab835","name":"Yuck","artist":"qB9A9Xe5759"},{"id":"eUffee7bd","name":"Time Without Consequence","artist":"6hP8b952"},{"id":"CmpM45630","name":"Vivadixiesubmarinetransmission...","artist":"c93R2e8d6"},{"id":"eDfC749ed","name":"Dreamt for Light Years in the ...","artist":"c93R2e8d6"},{"id":"eDfAea7e0","name":"It's a Wonderful Life","artist":"c93R2e8d6"},{"id":"kKB3d5388","name":"Muchacho","artist":"b4Zxed2e4"},{"id":"eWD857538","name":"Sun, Sun, Sun","artist":"WNGc1b9c"},{"id":"8agM3ee29","name":"Good Morning Spider","artist":"c93R2e8d6"},{"id":"nmTCQM7204d","name":"us","artist":"9sJXi2b688"},{"id":"yhEp5Yb911a","name":"Montage Of Heck: The Home Reco...","artist":"E5Zd3786"},{"id":"lTfEG744d6","name":"I AM","artist":"cAKa1Nd2b86"}],"artists":[{"id":"c93R2e8d6","name":"Sparklehorse"},{"id":"2Gi6e197","name":"PJ Harvey"},{"id":"mvhwQc5aa49","name":"詹盼"},{"id":"Wjea7e6f","name":"CocoRosie"},{"id":"SDDd9344","name":"Beck"},{"id":"31c84046","name":"Elliott Smith"},{"id":"m23Crb61515","name":"Gatsby in a Daze"},{"id":"bw4E1908d","name":"The Kills"},{"id":"iQ3sd7a87","name":"Mac DeMarco"},{"id":"8vc80b43","name":"Damon Albarn"},{"id":"dyPp3dc66","name":"Pavement"},{"id":"bhgGb9020","name":"U.N.P.O.C."}]},{"type":"style","id":"245","name":"前卫摇滚 Progressive Rock","description":"前卫摇滚（Progressive rock），有时简称为prog rock，是在1960年晚期兴起的摇滚乐分支之一，它的内涵十分复杂并且吸纳众多其他乐派精神，因此并不能明确地定义出其精确范围。前卫摇滚最热门最颠峰的时期是在1970年代的早期，并继续流传至今日。前卫摇滚起源自英国，大多数的团体多出现于欧洲大陆，只有少数几支乐团是来自于美国加拿大的。此种乐风通常结合了爵士乐、古典音乐、民间音乐和世界音乐等元素，不同于美国摇滚是受到R&B以及乡村音乐的影响。经由多年累积的发展，在前卫摇滚中也出现了像是：交响摇滚、艺术摇滚、数学摇滚以及前卫金属等类型。\n\n前卫摇滚乐手意图摆脱流行音乐的公式化及束缚，并亟力提升自身的音乐成就另外一种音乐类型，即便时常令人嗅到不小的古典与爵士影响。前卫摇滚最独特的地方便是“复杂”而不只是技术的出众，因为在流行音乐中技巧十分出众但却演奏单调乐章的乐手亦大有人在。\n\n前卫摇滚并无绝对定义，名团克里逊王的领袖Robert Fripp就十分厌恶这个音乐分类上的术语。而构筑出前卫摇滚的作品多集中在1970年代，像是：Jethro Tull，Yes，创世纪合唱团，平克·弗洛伊德，爱默生、雷克与帕玛，匆促乐团，皇后乐队与克里逊王等等，音乐各有不同特色，无法同一而论。这些乐手与乐评家们（如：Bill Martin）对自身是否真的属于前卫摇滚感到疑问（不过在此我们必须要做如此假设，至少是70年代的他们）。同时也有人在争辩像是：Frank Zappa，深紫，Phish，电台司令，和Tool这类活跃于其他乐种的乐手是否隶属于前卫摇滚之下。\n\nProgressive rock, also known as prog rock or prog, is a rock music subgenre that originated in the United Kingdom, with further developments in Germany, Italy, and France, throughout the mid-to-late 1960s and 1970s. It developed from psychedelic rock and originated, similarly to art rock, as an attempt to give greater artistic weight and credibility to rock music. Bands abandoned the short pop single in favor of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz or classical music in an effort to give rock music the same level of musical sophistication and critical respect. Songs were replaced by musical suites that often stretched to 20 or 40 minutes in length and contained symphonic influences, extended musical themes, fantasy-like ambiance and lyrics, and complex orchestrations. Music critics, who often labeled the concepts as \"pretentious\" and the sounds as \"pompous\" and \"overblown,\" tended to be hostile toward the genre or to completely ignore it. \nProgressive rock saw a high level of popularity throughout the 1970s, especially in the middle of the decade. Bands such as Jethro Tull, The Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, Yes, King Crimson, Genesis, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP) were the genre's most influential groups and were among the most popular acts of the era, although there were many other, often highly influential, bands who experienced a lesser degree of commercial success. The genre faded in popularity during the second half of the decade. Conventional wisdom holds that the rise of punk rock caused this, although in reality a number of factors contributed to this decline. Progressive rock bands achieved commercial success well into the 1980s, albeit with changed lineups and more compact song structures.\nThe genre grew out of the 1960s space rock of Pink Floyd and the classical rock experiments of bands like The Moody Blues, Procol Harum and The Nice. Most of the prominent bands from the genre's 1970s heyday fall into the \"symphonic prog\" category, in which classical orchestrations and compositional techniques are melded with rock music. Other subgenres exist, including the more accessible neo-progressive rock of the 1980s, the jazz-influenced Canterbury sound of the 1960s and 1970s, and the more political and experimental Rock in Opposition movement of the late 1970s and onward. Progressive rock has influenced genres such as krautrock and post-punk, and it has fused with other forms of rock music to create such sub-genres as neo-classical metal and progressive metal. A revival, often known as new prog, occurred at the turn of the 21st century and has since enjoyed a cult following.","songs":[{"id":"fDGpu43148","name":"Are You The One ","artist":"Et062dae"},{"id":"OFJT15569","name":"Unintended","artist":"6fV69232"},{"id":"gosSa72e70","name":"Wish You Were Here","artist":"2Je62da1"},{"id":"8GbsZ4eb2d5","name":"The Granary Canon","artist":"TPyabc98"},{"id":"gmQjv4975e","name":"For the Love of God","artist":"dQwb49683"},{"id":"b79m5cbfef","name":"Christmas Canon Rock","artist":"A8P5b103"},{"id":"8FZlkzfbc7c","name":"Wither","artist":"TPRcd0a7"},{"id":"cgI4E1d9ec","name":"Roundabout","artist":"SOScf5c2"},{"id":"b38N0a2f3e","name":"Moonlight Shadow","artist":"TOTd1935"},{"id":"b0SEtbf2e8","name":"Lazarus","artist":"T4hd686c"},{"id":"U2M84f470","name":"Mr. Blue Sky","artist":"beP1a41f9"},{"id":"eROFI34d95","name":"Wide Open Space","artist":"32o5eae5"}],"albums":[{"id":"eTJY59980","name":"The Wall","artist":"2Je62da1"},{"id":"8qWH639da","name":"Black Holes and Revelations","artist":"6fV69232"},{"id":"f2EX9137d","name":"Hymn to Life","artist":"Et062dae"},{"id":"C3fG48161","name":"Showbiz","artist":"6fV69232"},{"id":"eTJW85bc7","name":"Wish You Were Here","artist":"2Je62da1"},{"id":"8qLj604e4","name":"The Dark Side of the Moon","artist":"2Je62da1"},{"id":"eNxk956c2","name":"The 7th Song: Enchanting Guita...","artist":"dQwb49683"},{"id":"fD8H8a34c","name":"The Resistance","artist":"6fV69232"},{"id":"jX8a9faf2","name":"Always With You","artist":"TPyabc98"},{"id":"eTKcab759","name":"The Division Bell","artist":"2Je62da1"},{"id":"jDIk9888d","name":"HAARP","artist":"6fV69232"},{"id":"beiScb480","name":"In the Court of the Crimson Ki...","artist":"bsIMf3c9b"}],"artists":[{"id":"b45qfebee","name":"万能青年旅店"},{"id":"6fV69232","name":"Muse"},{"id":"2Je62da1","name":"Pink Floyd"},{"id":"hd5c8555","name":"椎名林檎"},{"id":"cj7p2a1b8","name":"Buckethead"},{"id":"gXkb51f3","name":"L'Arc〜en〜Ciel"},{"id":"eyG8dfab","name":"Mr.Children"},{"id":"bwv6fe54f","name":"東京事変"},{"id":"dyQ43df94","name":"Joe Satriani"},{"id":"cy3LdRb625b","name":"TK from 凛として時雨"},{"id":"TPRcd0a7","name":"Dream Theater"},{"id":"dQwb49683","name":"Steve Vai"}]},{"type":"style","id":"278","name":"华丽摇滚 Glam Rock","description":"华丽摇滚（Glam Rock或Glitter Rock）又称闪烁摇滚，是硬摇滚的一个分支，是摇滚乐和流行音乐的一个流派，特点是性别模糊的装扮，华丽戏剧化的台风和颓废慵懒的音乐风格。“Glam”来自单词“glamour”，指魔法与魅力。它产生、活跃和消亡于70年代的英国，高峰时期的代表人物包括英国的大卫·鲍伊、皇后乐队（70年代）、暴龙乐队、罗西音乐、加里·格利特。在美国也出现了一些华丽摇滚的歌手与乐队，如卢·里德、布鲁斯·韦恩·坎贝尔（Jobriath）、纽约娃娃等。\n\n而华丽摇滚最兴盛的70年代，年轻人从理想烂漫的60年代一路走来。当爱与和平成为一个陈旧而烂俗的口号，当群居和乱性使人始终处于混乱的状态之中，当成天戴着花朵，穿着彩虹衣，吸着大麻当街舞蹈再也无法激起人们的兴趣，当没有更多的战争需要反对，没有更多的压迫和暴力之后。年轻人很自然的开始思考如何更好的表达自我，如何娱乐生活，如何将青春点燃到另一个High的高度。这时候，他们选择的依旧是摇滚乐。一部分摇滚乐手也开始厌恶了嬉皮士们的虚弱和颓废，开始思量着创造另外一种更酷更炫更富有激情的音乐风格，于是，华丽摇滚诞生了。\n\n1974年，在Hollywood Palladium举办的“好莱坞街道的复兴和舞蹈”（Hollywood Street Revival and Dance）音乐会，参加的人包括了Iggy Pop 和他的助手乐队（Stooges），纽约妞乐队（the New York Dolls），还有Marc Bolan和他的雷克斯龙乐队（T.Rex）。在那场演唱会上，Marc Bolan宣布：“华丽摇滚死了（Glam Rock is dead）”。\n\n由创造了华丽摇滚的人宣布华丽摇滚的死亡，一如发掘了美的人来毁灭这种美，也算是最好的结局，总胜过使之自然风干老化成为过街老妪，在羞辱中灭亡。\n\n自华丽摇滚诞生到今天，已经过去三十多年。当年衣着性感，用极低和极高的嗓音滑越吉他SOLO，引爆音箱，放纵出耀眼的火花的少年们，今天业已融入社会，成为为人类进步贡献力量的墙上之砖。脱去镶嵌闪石，亮片的华服，穿上标有Giorgio Armani的黑色西装登堂入室，褪去发梢的红色，梳理下已见稀疏的头发，洗净妆容，等待岁月刻上皱纹。\n\nGlam rock (also known as glitter rock) is a style of rock and pop music that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, which was performed by singers and musicians who wore outrageous clothes, makeup and hairstyles, particularly platform-soled boots and glitter. The flamboyant costumes and visual styles of glam performers were often camp or androgynous, and have been connected with new views of gender roles.\nGlam rock peaked during the mid-1970s with artists including T. Rex, David Bowie, Sweet, Roxy Music and Gary Glitter in the UK and New York Dolls, Lou Reed and Jobriath in the US. It declined after 1976, but had a major influence on genres including punk, glam metal, New Romantics and gothic rock and has sporadically revived since the 1990s.","songs":[{"id":"bAXZZ13874","name":"We Will Rock You","artist":"2J26523c"},{"id":"b1xDoafd74","name":"Everything Will Flow","artist":"SN6e12a8"},{"id":"LpFM73b07","name":"Perfect Day","artist":"dyQb3f36e"},{"id":"cgwOxe66dc","name":"Common People","artist":"bsLmf9787"},{"id":"b0yELb5237","name":"Candle in the Wind","artist":"SHHd4250"},{"id":"mQNqOw76932","name":"Starman (Original Single Mix)","artist":"2Dm503c2"},{"id":"U5JyBi2cf57","name":"直到世界尽头","artist":"i6F16baf"},{"id":"d20hh2850d","name":"Junk Shop Clothes","artist":"3wQ923b8"},{"id":"b1rYnnD3c5bf","name":"我要开花","artist":"fU8978e1"},{"id":"mQ5A2a53e6e","name":"Innocence (MSN Control Room)","artist":"cmjk2cad8"},{"id":"b0wanb4b0a","name":"Bang a Gong (Get It On)","artist":"2MS5b0e5"},{"id":"U577Rf28d77","name":"Have You Ever Heard A Song","artist":"d26X435e1"}],"albums":[{"id":"f7YZ5e06b","name":"Queen Rocks","artist":"2J26523c"},{"id":"beFS14118","name":"A Night at the Opera","artist":"2J26523c"},{"id":"bffoad6f2","name":"Coming Up","artist":"SN6e12a8"},{"id":"EFa86b69","name":"News of the World","artist":"2J26523c"},{"id":"vNya2abc1","name":"Singles","artist":"SN6e12a8"},{"id":"b5gj1a876","name":"Head Music","artist":"SN6e12a8"},{"id":"jJDzb9259","name":"Stone Cold Classics","artist":"2J26523c"},{"id":"dkJU3b1ac","name":"Different Class","artist":"bsLmf9787"},{"id":"bUJH24065","name":"Transformer","artist":"dyQb3f36e"},{"id":"b4GZf3e31","name":"Made in Heaven","artist":"2J26523c"},{"id":"beFVde833","name":"Jazz","artist":"2J26523c"},{"id":"fG8v4e6e7","name":"Absolute Greatest","artist":"2J26523c"}],"artists":[{"id":"2J26523c","name":"Queen"},{"id":"SN6e12a8","name":"Suede"},{"id":"Wh3b3ee5","name":"MIKA"},{"id":"SEbc4cce","name":"Bon Jovi"},{"id":"2Dm503c2","name":"David Bowie"},{"id":"dyQb3f36e","name":"Lou Reed"},{"id":"2Fg4d0f3","name":"Brian Eno"},{"id":"2MS5b0e5","name":"T.

The early fusions of industrial music and rock were practiced by a handful of post-punk groups, including Chrome, Killing Joke, Swans, Foetus and Big Black.","songs":[{"id":"b0QUmc2178","name":"Lamb of God","artist":"2HD633b2"},{"id":"f4RWk3e59b","name":"Every Day Is Exactly the Same","artist":"SJ0c5136"},{"id":"MdUO7a279","name":"Sorcerers","artist":"cAwu2f12e"},{"id":"JALYsu348af","name":"Straight to Video","artist":"WgMcbe5b"},{"id":"PC9t79d8e","name":"Looking Glass","artist":"79Y5c60b"},{"id":"JAWd8Q22b39","name":"Brennisteinn","artist":"33w60621"},{"id":"fNwM8e4e0","name":"狂人日记","artist":"i9Ufbeac"},{"id":"Lurj7dbae","name":"Until We Say Goodbye","artist":"dyQ43df94"},{"id":"JALOVL25874","name":"People of The Lie (Requiem Mix)","artist":"2He5de9b"},{"id":"8Ge3ng1845a","name":"I'm Afraid of Americans","artist":"2Dm503c2"},{"id":"xL2obxa3b5c","name":"鸣沙","artist":"GZc532cd"},{"id":"MkbA76c2f","name":"Automatic Lover","artist":"4rV5cb08"}],"albums":[{"id":"Esj4bf75","name":"The Golden Age of Grotesque","artist":"2HD633b2"},{"id":"betadd809","name":"Holy Wood (In the Shadow of th...","artist":"2HD633b2"},{"id":"ctlbxJa4529","name":"The Pale Emperor","artist":"2HD633b2"},{"id":"f1li93c0a","name":"Lest We Forget: The Best Of","artist":"2HD633b2"},{"id":"fAchd49ba","name":"The High End of Low","artist":"2HD633b2"},{"id":"bUuT23996","name":"Eat Me, Drink Me","artist":"2HD633b2"},{"id":"besYf2bb9","name":"Mechanical Animals","artist":"2HD633b2"},{"id":"k0fwb1123","name":"Born Villain","artist":"2HD633b2"},{"id":"bU7d255fa","name":"The Downward Spiral","artist":"SJ0c5136"},{"id":"E4z8bcd0","name":"With Teeth","artist":"SJ0c5136"},{"id":"nnev826ac53","name":"Heaven Upside Down","artist":"2HD633b2"},{"id":"dkx334d3d","name":"Antichrist Superstar","artist":"2HD633b2"}],"artists":[{"id":"2HD633b2","name":"Marilyn Manson"},{"id":"SJ0c5136","name":"Nine Inch Nails"},{"id":"Fdg6d18d","name":"Unheilig"},{"id":"3vZ59025","name":"Laibach"},{"id":"SJ7ce638","name":"Gary Numan"},{"id":"i9Ufbeac","name":"秋天的虫子"},{"id":"b5Elf1c77","name":"Trent Reznor"},{"id":"2GX8b9c8","name":"Killing Joke"},{"id":"2He5de9b","name":"KMFDM"},{"id":"79Y5c60b","name":"The Birthday Massacre"},{"id":"b6mjf700b","name":"Skinny Puppy"},{"id":"T0Rd0be6","name":"Alien Sex Fiend"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1339","name":"数学摇滚 Math Rock","description":"数学摇滚（Math-rock）是一种实验性的摇滚风格，80年代后期 萌芽于美国。\n\n数学摇滚曲风大多混合噪音摇滚（Noise rock)、后摇滚(Post rock)、前卫摇滚(progressive rock)、简约音乐(Minimal music)、电子音乐(Electronic music)等。它的一个特点是编曲复杂，经常使用不规则停顿或开始、不自然节拍结构（odd time signatures）、棱形旋律（Angular melody）、对位法（counterpoint）、延伸和弦（extended chords）、不协调和弦（dissonant chords）、非典型和弦进行(atypical Chord progression）。一般摇滚乐都以 4/4 拍 作歌曲结构，而数学摇滚则频繁使用不对称节拍，如 7/8 拍, 11/8 拍, 13/8 拍，并于歌曲中交错换拍， 例如一小段 9/8 拍，转换至 8/8 拍 ，再转换至 6/8 拍，让听众有错摸的诡异感觉。 又例如，在同一首乐曲使用 3/4 拍的鼓、4/4 拍的吉他、3/4 拍的低音吉他，却让每样乐器巧妙地于不同音轨上“对在一起”，听起来又顺畅不碍耳。因复杂结构如数学运算，故此称为“数学摇滚”。\nMath Rock和后摇滚（Post Rock）有点沾亲带故，更为人熟知的是其作为Indie-Rock风格，它和Indie-Rock有着相近的音乐取向。在Post-Rock有着明显的爵士乐影响的地方，Math Rock则就如同是一枚硬币的反面－它的音乐显得浓厚而复杂，同时充满着艰涩的拍子记号和缠结在一起的乐段。而且，这种音乐比后摇滚要更为摇滚一些，因为它通常是由以吉他为主乐器的小乐队演绎。 Math Rock在90年代中期达到顶峰，那时，像Polvo和Chavez这些乐队在大学校园的独立摇滚乐人中有少数专注于这种音乐的追随者。\n\nMath rock is a genre that developed in the late 1980s to early 1990s via the influence of bands such as Slint, Drive Like Jehu and Shellac who added to the already established sounds of Noise Rock and Post-Hardcore a sense of rhythmic variety and complexity that was claimed by many critics to sound almost mathematical, eventually being coined \"math rock\". It became a large influence on some underground movements in the US and became a common instrumental style of certain genres including many bands of the Midwest Emo and Indie Rock scene. \n\nBy the dawn of the 21st century the sound of math rock was even more riff focused. Emphasised by polyrhythmic and winding yet consonant guitar riffs with the bass often used as a counter melody, vocals were usually used as a secondary instrument to the guitar or not at all. The genre took further influences from Jazz-Rock and Post-Rock often sounding both accessible and experimental with the dissonance of earlier math rock groups being far less dominant. Modern math rock groups include Don Caballero, Hella, 65daysofstatic and Tera Melos. Some modern groups have also acquired mainstream success whilst using math rock influences. These bands include Battles, Minus the Bear and Foals that further show math rock's gradual divergence from the underground.","songs":[{"id":"bCkKRi24a15e","name":"迷航","artist":"MHq7aa65"},{"id":"8Ga9ovfb1b7","name":"グッドバイ","artist":"ZZIb1f39"},{"id":"mQEuij7c5e0","name":"My Number","artist":"bxjb1a01b"},{"id":"8HMZTP19a78","name":"电动少女","artist":"neHuf29fe"},{"id":"8GsZ5Ve483c","name":"船","artist":"cftvMU82b74"},{"id":"xNcBade09de","name":"Diamond Cut","artist":"bjescd39a"},{"id":"xNNkq8bba53","name":"噩梦","artist":"cc1LFY7108b"},{"id":"guaC349213","name":"grave","artist":"EBh50008"},{"id":"mSu05760578","name":"GriffO-Afflatus (3ASiC Remix )","artist":"cVWoG2bc733"},{"id":"etdCW2d7ce","name":"欲は全ての言葉を話し、全ての役を演じ、無欲者すら『演』ずる。","artist":"cM5F32aff"},{"id":"8GnkOUe90b8","name":"Love Ain't Red","artist":"b7V41db94"},{"id":"bqvcMwC3a650","name":"lost in addiction","artist":"cMM133640"}],"albums":[{"id":"nmTmjw6d885","name":"Chinese Football","artist":"neHuf29fe"},{"id":"fkaw8bec0","name":"the book about my idle plot on...","artist":"ZZIb1f39"},{"id":"kMiPcd30b","name":"Holy Fire","artist":"bxjb1a01b"},{"id":"ofMFff057","name":"For Long Tomorrow","artist":"ZZIb1f39"},{"id":"d9ZnVBfab13","name":"迷航","artist":"MHq7aa65"},{"id":"yhOGbk96aad","name":"Here comes a new challenger!","artist":"neHuf29fe"},{"id":"pVsJsa1e47","name":"HEAR YOU","artist":"ZZIb1f39"},{"id":"cQP7ZZ13b21","name":"象","artist":"cftvMU82b74"},{"id":"pKIqfb6bf0","name":"Chinese Football May 28th.2015...","artist":"neHuf29fe"},{"id":"8GeYX026891","name":"平衡","artist":"cc1LFY7108b"},{"id":"yhOLSy12a6c","name":"Diamond Cut","artist":"bjescd39a"},{"id":"9fcB3f386","name":"The King Lost His Pink","artist":"b7V41db94"}],"artists":[{"id":"cy3LdRb625b","name":"TK from 凛として時雨"},{"id":"ZZIb1f39","name":"toe"},{"id":"cvaU2b2e3","name":"凛として時雨"},{"id":"neHuf29fe","name":"Chinese Football"},{"id":"bxjb1a01b","name":"Foals"},{"id":"dlqu37e17","name":"相対性理論"},{"id":"cc1LFY7108b","name":"大象体操"},{"id":"cM5F32aff","name":"té"},{"id":"cnyJ2a1b1","name":"65daysofstatic"},{"id":"b7V41db94","name":"Chochukmo"},{"id":"bgv9b2226","name":"mouse on the keys"},{"id":"bj1ca786c","name":"Totorro"}]},{"type":"style","id":"689","name":"后垃圾摇滚 Post-Grunge","description":"西雅图Grunge音乐对美国主流音乐产生影响不久，就出现了一批所谓Post-Grunge风格的乐队。他们与西雅图Grunge音乐的主要区别在于：西雅图Grunge音乐坚定地追随了80年代的地下另类摇滚乐风格，而Post-Grunge音乐则更多地被概念上的Grunge音乐风格----内在形式广泛流行的，思想严肃的重摇滚----所影响。所以很多Post-Grunge风格的乐队只是简单地模仿了Grunge音乐的风格表达，却不具有最初Grunge艺术的独立特质。\n\nPost-Grunge乐队承袭了典型Grunge音乐中充满焦虑，冷静自省的音乐风格，并将其看作是Grunge艺术的必要元素。即使处于低蘼时期，Post-Grunge乐队们也保持了十分严肃清醒的态度对待自身的存在，最终，Grunge音乐的独特元素成为了正统音乐本质上不可或缺的成分。Post-Grunge风格几乎影响了整个90年代的主流成熟的重摇滚音乐。虽然音乐中包含了另类的元素，Post-Grunge依然是一种主流商业音乐----其浑厚流转的Grunge吉他演奏是音乐优美流畅，脍炙人口。很多乐队在风格上十分相似却又不完全相同；除了旧式Grunge音乐，Post-Grunge还借鉴了80年代初期的喧闹流行，朋克流行，复兴斯卡乐，另类金属和古典纪念摇滚等音乐风格。此外，一部分怪异的Post-Grunge风格的物品还因其黑色幽默而非低调忧郁而大受欢迎。Post-Grunge音乐在旧式Grunge音乐产生不久后就已经浮出水面；代表旧式Grunge风格的nirvana乐队于1992年初进入巅峰时期，短短几年后，Post-Grunge风格的bush乐队和candlebox乐队也获得了巨大的成功。旧式Grunge音乐最初的的鼎盛时期过去后，Post-Grunge风格开始兴起，90年代中期到末期涌现出一批新生乐队；其中一部分持续走红，而另一些则昙花一现。时至今日，Post-Grunge风格仍然兴盛不衰，creed和matchbox20是美国最受欢迎的两支该风格乐队。\nPost-grunge is a derivative of grunge and a style of alternative rock and hard rock that began in the 1990s. Originally, post-grunge was an almost pejorative label used to describe bands that emulated the grunge sound. During this time, bands like Bush, Candlebox and Collective Soul were viewed as post-grunge.\nIn the late 1990s, post-grunge morphed into a more clearly defined style that married the sound and aesthetic of grunge with a more mainstream approach. Post-grunge rose to prominence in the 1990s and continued to remain popular in the 2000s. Post-grunge bands such as Foo Fighters, Puddle of Mudd, Staind, Nickelback, Creed and Matchbox Twenty all achieved mainstream success.\nDuring the 1990s, a post-grunge sound emerged which emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly its thick, distorted guitars, but with a more commercially accessible tone.Unlike a lot of early grunge bands, post-grunge bands often worked through major record labels and incorporated influences from a variety of musical genres including: jangle pop, pop punk, ska revival, alternative metal and classic rock. Post-grunge music tends to be in mid-tempo and is noted for having \"a polished, radio-ready production\". Grierson of About.com wrote that musically, post-grunge bands \"split the difference between plaintive ballads and aggressive rockers, resulting in songs that combine the two extremes into a sad-eyed, propulsive middle ground\".Post-grunge tends to feature the \"...same kind of melody as...bubblegum pop\" and pop song structures. Sometimes post-grunge music features both an electric guitar and an acoustic guitar playing simultaneously. Post-grunge tends to have production quality that is much higher and cleaner than grunge.\nA \"major rift\" between grunge and post-grunge is in the lyrical substance of the music; grunge expressed emotion through loose metaphors or third-person narratives, while post-grunge was known for being direct and blunt. While describing lyrics that are common in post-grunge, Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound wrote that post-grunge \"plunged directly into the \"I.\" \" Geffen wrote that most post-grunge songs that achieved mainstream success \"call after a prospective or past companion in the first person\". Post-grunge lyrics also tend to be about topics such as relationships, romance and drug addiction. According to Geffen, \"grunge's frontmen posed with their addictions; post-grunge's songwriters sought redemption for them\". Geffen states that post-grunge songs \"fit the mold of songs made for...teenage and pre-teen girls\" who were \"longing for a distant someone\", and the songs \"wore signs of femininity\" which she posits may be why the \"...post-grunge moment pissed off so many angry dudes.\" According to Geffen, artists such as Alanis Morissette, No Doubt and Sarah McLachlan all \"crystallized the songwriting strategy that would form the emotional core of the post-grunge moment\".\nPost-grunge is a derivative of Grunge that emerged in the mid-1990s with bands such as Live, Bush, and Foo Fighters. Although it adopted the vocal style, angsty lyrics, and \"dirty\" guitar sound of grunge, the songwriting placed more emphasis on pop hooks and conventional song structures. It became one of the leading popular music genres from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, particularly following the death of Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain in 1994. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the genre reached its peak in popularity with the rise of such bands as Creed and Nickelback.","songs":[{"id":"mQ6vKy53ba0","name":"Open Up Your Heart And Let The Sun Shine In","artist":"6lO6a441"},{"id":"cQ7tm203d6","name":"Complicated","artist":"cmjk2cad8"},{"id":"b4DUpc41c3","name":"If Everyone Cared","artist":"6g185b37"},{"id":"OJ2s4bb94","name":"The Reason","artist":"6jG76384"},{"id":"cgQKOf3413","name":"Daisy Lane","artist":"btE917a9e"},{"id":"mQ5Wki53271","name":"Make Me Wanna Die","artist":"I3C699b0"},{"id":"b4yHu9b8d2","name":"Angels or Devils","artist":"T8xd1574"},{"id":"xLp68h9b786","name":"It Is What It Is","artist":"37S8e248"},{"id":"b5jNVbebbf","name":"The Diary of Jane","artist":"bwR62d09e"},{"id":"b0TsMc063f","name":"Iris","artist":"TyPca235"},{"id":"clHJZe9089","name":"Wherever You Will Go","artist":"XZhde70d"},{"id":"OK4s57469","name":"It's Not Over","artist":"bgq4c37c5"}],"albums":[{"id":"vG2o268a8","name":"Let Go","artist":"cmjk2cad8"},{"id":"jghx97aa7","name":"All The Right Reasons","artist":"6g185b37"},{"id":"ka8Haaa59","name":"The Pretty Reckless","artist":"I3C699b0"},{"id":"fQEu6d33d","name":"Light Me Up","artist":"I3C699b0"},{"id":"r4D91e985","name":"The Reason","artist":"6jG76384"},{"id":"eEQh6de52","name":"Opaline","artist":"T8xd1574"},{"id":"mEyc1a57ff4","name":"Going To Hell","artist":"I3C699b0"},{"id":"v2BG284eb","name":"Pull the Pin","artist":"btE917a9e"},{"id":"fHlA75ce2","name":"Smoke & Mirrors","artist":"37S8e248"},{"id":"jG3Qa1ff3","name":"Dark Horse","artist":"6g185b37"},{"id":"eUrDd7870","name":"Daughtry","artist":"bgq4c37c5"},{"id":"xc9Wj499813","name":"No Fixed Address","artist":"6g185b37"}],"artists":[{"id":"6g185b37","name":"Nickelback"},{"id":"I3C699b0","name":"The Pretty Reckless"},{"id":"3xNcc804","name":"Foo Fighters"},{"id":"37S8e248","name":"Lifehouse"},{"id":"bgq4c37c5","name":"Daughtry"},{"id":"6jG76384","name":"Hoobastank"},{"id":"bwR62d09e","name":"Breaking Benjamin"},{"id":"6f251005","name":"Dolores O'Riordan"},{"id":"SJccc76e","name":"Alanis Morissette"},{"id":"d2xe421a3","name":"Seether"},{"id":"XZhde70d","name":"The Calling"},{"id":"6Po9428f","name":"Hinder"}]},{"type":"style","id":"295","name":"说唱摇滚 Rap Rock","description":"说唱摇滚（Rap Rock）是说唱金属的一种延续，它是由 Anthrax 这样的乐队所倡导的说唱与重金属的混合体。说唱金属有着大量的不规则的古典和非常厚重的反复—有的时候，那些反复简直像是通过在吉他上乱擦和用拳击式的拍子敲打录制成的。相比之下，说唱摇滚则更有组织，经常歌手是因为这是一首摇滚歌曲才会在某些地方用说代替了唱。不过无论如何，在它的节奏里面当然也还是有着说唱的节奏的，因为说唱摇滚中含有更多的疯克元素而不是普通的硬摇滚元素。有时候，说唱金属与说唱摇滚之间的差别是很微小的，因为他们两个都很喜欢嘹亮的吉他与鼓点；因而二者最主要的区别就是说唱摇滚那有组织的、完整而和谐的声音了，其最好的体现就是 Kid Rock 在1998年推出的那张说唱摇滚杰作 Devil Without a Cause。\n\nRap rock is a cross-genre fusing vocal and instrumental elements of hip hop with various forms of rock.

Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from genres such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.\nIts music was created with the intention of listening and contemplation rather than for dancing, and is often distinguished by the use of electronic effects and easy listening textures far removed from the propulsive rhythms of early rock.The term may sometimes be used interchangeably with \"progressive rock\", though the latter is instead characterized in particular by its employment of classically trained instrumental technique and symphonic textures.\n\nThe genre's greatest level of popularity was in the early 1970s through British artists. The music, as well as the theatrical nature of performances associated with the genre, was able to appeal to artistically inclined adolescents and younger adults, especially due to its virtuosity and musical/lyrical complexity.Art rock is most associated with a certain period of rock music, beginning in 1966–67 and ending with the arrival of punk in the mid 1970s. After, the genre would be infused within later popular music genres of the 1970s–90s.\nThe term art rock has been employed to describe several works of Rock music developed right after the 1960s Psychedelic Rock explosion. Following on the heels of this phenomenon, art rock has been the result of musicians developing an interest towards a handful of forms of music out of the boundaries of rock and, in general terms, making an attempt to break away as much as possible from the constrains imposed by Rock & Roll (or from the roots of rock itself, which, in turn, inspired genres like Blues Rock, Country Rock or U.S. Folk Rock). A non-musical factor that could explain this development is the conscious transition that certain rock (and non-rock) artists made from singles-based music towards a bigger development of the album as a cohesive lyrical and thematic whole (an important step towards the popularization of the so-called Concept Album) as shown by the 1966–1967 set of examples like Pet Sounds, Freak Out!, The Who Sell Out or Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (which can be counted as forerunners of later art rock).&nbsp;\n\nThe Velvet Underground & Nico, which interpolated raw Garage Rock and psychedelia with lengthy Modern Classical-inspired drone and noise passages, unorthodox guitar tunings with heavy use of feedback, and subject matter generally centered around stark lyrical topics (all tied in with elaborate pop art-inspired imagery and live performances) is considered by critics and fans as the starting point of art rock. This template of limit-breaching rock music, concept-oriented LPs and complex live performances would be the basis for many artists during the 70s that added various influences to this archetype, including Jazz, Western Classical Music, Funk, avant-garde and early Electronic and Ambient music (and even instrumentation typical of some of these styles). Examples of art rock musicians during this stage include Roxy Music (along with the solo careers of Brian Eno and Phil Manzanera, as well as the Roxy-related 801), Pink Floyd, Station to Station/Berlin trilogy-era David Bowie, Peter Gabriel, Barclay James Harvest, Steve Harley/Cockney Rebel and ex-Velvet Underground members Lou Reed and John Cale.&nbsp;\n\nEver since its beginnings, art rock has shared connections, musical ties and even presents apparent overlaps with Experimental Rock and Progressive Rock (eventually also bearing a relationship with styles like Art Pop, Glam Rock, Krautrock and Jazz-Rock). While art rock strives to find a level of complexity similar to the one present in these two affiliated genres, it generally features a mix of rock music that tends to follow certain Pop-based structures or patterns along with the aforementioned set of eclectic influences and certain degree of complexity and conceptuality, in contrast to the more classical/jazz-mimicking or inspired patterns of prog suites, or the more radical and angular experimental rock.\n\nAfter the Punk Rock explosion of the second half of the 1970s, art rock dissolved, during the following decades, into other forms of rock music, including (but not limited to): Post-Punk, New Wave, Art Punk, and Post-Hardcore. The 1990s and 2000s would then see a series of newer bands taking inspiration from the musical and conceptual leanings of 60s/70s art rock acts (along with other influences) and as such, groups like late-90s/early-00s Radiohead, The Mars Volta, TV on the Radio, dEUS, АукцЫон [Auktyon], and The Mollusk-era Ween have been commonly credited with reviving popular interest in the genre into the new millennium.","songs":[{"id":"8GrKiuefe4e","name":"unravel","artist":"cy3LdRb625b"},{"id":"cgzpgee993","name":"No Surprises","artist":"2J6912ec"},{"id":"KCG173a8c","name":"Sunday Morning","artist":"SO0d37b7"},{"id":"cgh8Tfbcd3","name":"Easy Money","artist":"WHD99fb6"},{"id":"b1Nawbe0c8","name":"For the Damaged Coda","artist":"bt5Sfb49b"},{"id":"xLrwYzb62ea","name":"A Whiter Shade Of Pale","artist":"SKpd155b"},{"id":"b1lurc296b","name":"China Girl","artist":"SKf9ebec"},{"id":"mQNqOw76932","name":"Starman (Original Single Mix)","artist":"2Dm503c2"},{"id":"b4AYVcd818","name":"Wake Up","artist":"Wftac6a3"},{"id":"Lwze88e2a","name":"For Martha","artist":"SMGde714"},{"id":"mQO7fR77255","name":"Go Out","artist":"SDY10585"},{"id":"bf0rgrJ304dc","name":"Kiss In Blue","artist":"bttveccda"}],"albums":[{"id":"cCMLMI9b551","name":"unravel","artist":"cy3LdRb625b"},{"id":"beGE98b53","name":"OK Computer","artist":"2J6912ec"},{"id":"Fn8623d1","name":"The Velvet Underground & Nico","artist":"SO0d37b7"},{"id":"FnA4d630","name":"The Velvet Underground","artist":"SO0d37b7"},{"id":"bfMGFmI2db1a","name":"A Moon Shaped Pool","artist":"2J6912ec"},{"id":"bWO3a57e","name":"黑洞","artist":"8raf910"},{"id":"bdsVcd3b6","name":"Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orp...","artist":"WHD99fb6"},{"id":"h1l8aH2da6a","name":"Nothing Has Changed","artist":"2Dm503c2"},{"id":"86m9QK1bfe2","name":"The Magic Whip","artist":"SDY10585"},{"id":"cfwpsf8191c","name":"The Endless River","artist":"2Je62da1"},{"id":"nca5e36e6","name":"Melody of Certain Damaged Lemo...","artist":"bt5Sfb49b"},{"id":"bUXq3234a","name":"Adore","artist":"SMGde714"}],"artists":[{"id":"2Je62da1","name":"Pink Floyd"},{"id":"2Dm503c2","name":"David Bowie"},{"id":"SO0d37b7","name":"The Velvet Underground"},{"id":"b4v0f21d2","name":"Sound Horizon"},{"id":"SKf9ebec","name":"Iggy Pop"},{"id":"WHD99fb6","name":"Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds"},{"id":"Wftac6a3","name":"Arcade Fire"},{"id":"2E379043","name":"Deep Purple"},{"id":"nmS0Lw70622","name":"假假條"},{"id":"SNU9cf9b","name":"Television"},{"id":"SOScf5c2","name":"Yes"},{"id":"2I45ec3b","name":"Nico"}]},{"type":"style","id":"368","name":"默西之声 Merseybeat","description":"默西之声是英式入侵的音乐源头，它强劲而有旋律性，是美国的摇滚与R&B,以及英国的噪音爵士的混合体。披头士早期的唱片，如\"Please Please Me\" 和 \"Love Me Do\" ，就是这种流派的原型。不久之后，其它一些利物浦的乐队，如Gerry & the Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer, 和 the Searchers也追随了此种风格。它之所以被称为“默西之声”是因为利物浦那条叫默西的河，此种风格在整个1963年和1964年的前半年极其风靡。但没过多久，一些R&B导向的乐队，如the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, 和 the Yardbirds出现了，同时出现的还有一些流行团体，如the Hollies 和 Freddie & the Dreamers。虽然这些团体都受到了默西之声的影响，但是这种风格本身却渐渐失去了根基，而披头士乐队也将他们的风格形式扩展到了更广的范围。\n\nMerseybeat is a light, highly melodic style of Beat Music popular in the UK during the early 1960s, named due to the abundance of bands from Liverpool beside the River Mersey. Merseybeat groups characteristically had simple guitar-dominated line-ups, with close vocal harmonies and catchy tunes. The resulting sound is chirpy, bouncy and simplistic, drawing influences from Rock & Roll, British Rhythm & Blues and late 1950s/early 1960s singles by acts such as Buddy Holly & The Crickets and Cliff Richard & The Shadows. The release of The Beatles' \"Love Me Do\" in October 1962 is an important focal point for the huge popularity of the sound between 1963 and 1965 in the UK (and the early first 'British Invasion' in the USA), with bands such as Gerry and The Pacemakers, Billy J. Kramer & The Dakotas, The Searchers, The Merseybeats and The Fourmost achieving consistent success in the hit parade. \n\nThe most popular line-up comprised of lead, rhythm and bass guitars with drums. It is typified by the synchronization of the bass guitar (usually playing only the root and fifth notes of the chords) and the bass drum. Unlike in rock & roll, Merseybeat groups often incorporate two and three-part harmonies, and even those with a separate lead singer will often sing both verses and choruses in close harmony; the Liverpool accent also has a major role in the distinctive overall sound. Although there are instrumental breaks, the focus is on the presentation of the song rather than instrumental prowess. \n\nIt is important to note that merseybeat is not simply a synonym for \"any beat music made by Liverpudlian bands\". This is exemplified by the rougher, more proto-Garage Rock sounds of \"Walking the Dog\" by The Dennisons and \"Peter Gunn Locomotion\" by Freddie Starr and The Midnighters.","songs":[{"id":"U48H6d6a1","name":"Hey Jude","artist":"c8Hl32a9c"},{"id":"MUN871d08","name":"Five Hundred Miles","artist":"4ti4f26a"},{"id":"mQ5Dsb5d4e5","name":"Love Potion No. 9","artist":"ciOW4125d"},{"id":"mQ4aKc4da29","name":"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother","artist":"dyMC3fb4c"},{"id":"bCk8Zxw4689b","name":"You'll Never Walk Alone","artist":"2FP81cdc"},{"id":"mQD9Yt87b4e","name":"Jerk It Out","artist":"cC2w32995"},{"id":"8GjkMGe58d9","name":"Because","artist":"2DP6c1dc"},{"id":"xLxY6Fcb4bc","name":"A Groovy Kind Of Love","artist":"4DP8ee51"},{"id":"S3uO7eb3d","name":"Dizzy Miss Lizzy","artist":"BQM8efbc"},{"id":"MNk78fc93","name":"I'll Never Dance Again","artist":"UtPc6319"},{"id":"8GbmQ3eef37","name":"Bad To Me","artist":"bKG42249a"},{"id":"xLycI8adad6","name":"Save The Last Dance For Me","artist":"UFbcf9ed"}],"albums":[{"id":"f51I4fec9","name":"Love","artist":"c8Hl32a9c"},{"id":"r4y623f50","name":"1 (2015 Version)","artist":"c8Hl32a9c"},{"id":"DgR8eb6c","name":"Let It Be","artist":"c8Hl32a9c"},{"id":"bdhDde063","name":"Help!","artist":"c8Hl32a9c"},{"id":"b3i8f76bc","name":"Rubber Soul","artist":"c8Hl32a9c"},{"id":"DgOa7516","name":"The Beatles","artist":"c8Hl32a9c"},{"id":"nnegMc7560e","name":"The Beatles Collection","artist":"c8Hl32a9c"},{"id":"ryKh1ea37","name":"A   World Without Love","artist":"4ti4f26a"},{"id":"9c93LUea1aa","name":"The Beatles Ballads","artist":"c8Hl32a9c"},{"id":"ctk128dbc","name":"Yellow Submarine","artist":"c8Hl32a9c"},{"id":"DgM646ac","name":"Sgt.

It was initially a somewhat controversial style in Christian circles, as more conservative elements believed all rock & roll to be inherently evil by nature, and gospel radio programmers were accordingly reluctant to program the music when it appeared during the mid-'70s. But others began to see Christian rock as an effective way to reach the unconverted, wrapping spiritual messages in an attractive package that strongly resembled a highly popular mainstream musical style. Petra's two Dove Award nominations in 1984 effectively signaled the gospel music community's acceptance of Christian rock as a viable and legitimate form, and helped pave the way for the heavier, flashier Christian style known as heaven's metal (itself an attempt to hook secular fans with an already established sound and spiritual lyrics). Harder, more uptempo Christian rock songs often try to project a firm, tough-minded, unshakable religious attitude, in keeping with the aggressive sound of the music, although many Christian rock bands have a fondness for majestic, sweeping power ballads; in both cases, the polished, squeaky-clean production is often just as close to the sheen of CCM pop as to the already slick sound of much AOR. Although some Christian rock bands experimented with rawer, more biting sounds in the late '80s and early '90s, the associations between the established conventions of big, anthemic hooks, loud yet smoothed-out guitars, and intense (yet fundamentally safe) spiritual emotion never completely died down. That time period also witnessed the unique phenomenon of King's X, a band with roots in Christian rock which garnered a devoted cult following among secular listeners and critics, thanks to its willingness to deviate from established musical formulas and address spirituality in more general terms. As alternative CCM began to capture larger portions of the Christian rock audience during the mid- to late '90s, many Christian rock heavyweights conceded the impact of mainstream alternative rock and shifted their brands of hard rock accordingly, although Petra soldiered on into the new millennium with their sound virtually unchanged.","songs":[{"id":"QiBNd7e21","name":"Along the Wall","artist":"8xW68d20"},{"id":"mQ5ogPc3360","name":"There Is Love","artist":"b5co1d28f"},{"id":"bqvcnvA3a59f","name":"Love Like You Loved","artist":"bfNt14f43"},{"id":"mQILFMd98ac","name":"FireFly","artist":"bVWu24e93"},{"id":"mQ4uJR7134d","name":"Yet","artist":"62z5a39f"},{"id":"xL2aUTfb37c","name":"Giving Up The Gun","artist":"8K66b271"},{"id":"b1pN7Qj4333d","name":"Don’t You Know You’re Beautiful","artist":"E8y6cd99"},{"id":"mQ4oWt7049d","name":"What Faith Can Do","artist":"bxsq16bdf"},{"id":"b5V0Kb7f17","name":"Comatose","artist":"d4r53f8a5"},{"id":"mQBBet652dc","name":"The Same Love","artist":"L8Y8777b"}],"albums":[{"id":"w7vM26d3f","name":"That Was Then This Is Now","artist":"b5co1d28f"},{"id":"n1p3f408d","name":"Blue on Blue","artist":"8xW68d20"},{"id":"x92Wdndde71","name":"Brave","artist":"bVWu24e93"},{"id":"jLNEcb22b","name":"More Beautiful You","artist":"bfNt14f43"},{"id":"jSmiba2f7","name":"Hello Hurricane","artist":"62z5a39f"},{"id":"fD4m6fe8d","name":"Awake","artist":"d4r53f8a5"},{"id":"rC5L1eded","name":"Comatose","artist":"d4r53f8a5"},{"id":"x82EJDbc3e3","name":"Water & Guns","artist":"8K66b271"},{"id":"eFII7931e","name":"Sixpence None the Richer","artist":"3Bd5b91e"},{"id":"eWh5781b6","name":"Ending Is Beginning","artist":"6CR8abe4"},{"id":"84vBQWf02ae","name":"Welcome to the New","artist":"d3gV3e751"},{"id":"jRGWdcefb","name":"It Is Well","artist":"bxsq16bdf"}],"artists":[{"id":"Mpb585f9","name":"Anthem Lights"},{"id":"d4r53f8a5","name":"Skillet"},{"id":"b9u7f8f57","name":"Hillsong United"},{"id":"62z5a39f","name":"Switchfoot"},{"id":"E8y6cd99","name":"Seabird"},{"id":"eHhu6d9cf","name":"Citizen Way"},{"id":"bfNt14f43","name":"Jonny Diaz"},{"id":"8kM55d46","name":"Fireflight"},{"id":"Utqde506","name":"Plumb"},{"id":"bVWu24e93","name":"Shawn McDonald"},{"id":"b5co1d28f","name":"Chasen"},{"id":"beKjdcd67","name":"Tenth Avenue North"}]},{"type":"style","id":"680","name":"喜剧摇滚 Comedy Rock","description":"喜剧摇滚是在摇滚中被设计成取笑传统和主流社会的摇滚音乐。在曲调和歌词上的抨击使它显得很幽默。有时喜剧摇滚是不成熟的---这种风格的教父: Frank Zappa, 喜欢对废物排放问题和傻瓜开玩笑——但是它最好的一面是：它很聪明的将陈词滥调与传统串联在一起。\n\n在摇滚音乐中的喜剧摇滚，从主流中冲出,在中国国内的摇滚大地上独树一帜，调侃的曲风，诙谐的词语，细腻的制作，形成了自己的氛围与线路。把民间曲艺与摇滚音乐相结合是中国喜剧摇滚的特点，也是有别与世界各地其他喜剧摇滚，而更具有内涵的新音乐。\n\nComedy Rock is roughly defined as a mix of Rock or any of its sub-genres with elements of Comedy such as Satire and Musical Parody, as well as concepts of Novelty music.

While progressive rock bands infuse Rock with elements from more traditional forms of Western Classical Music and Jazz, avant-prog artists draw more inspiration from Modern Classical and Avant-Garde Jazz, as well as the unorthodox instrumentation and techniques of Experimental Rock. The music is highly complex and densely arranged, sometimes involving a certain degree of improvisation but for the most part carefully composed (although many bands have recorded entirely improvised pieces as well). Avant-prog tends to be more abstract in nature than other styles of progressive rock, and as such many artists make exclusively instrumental music. If there are vocals they're often wordless, or in certain cases sung in a language invented by the artist. This is particularly common for vocal pieces in the Zeuhl subgenre.&nbsp;\n\nFrank Zappa's work with the Mothers of Invention could arguably be considered the earliest example of avant-prog.

One of the most distinctive elements of folk-rock is the chiming, ringing guitar hooks, coupled with clear vocal harmonies. Folk-rock was pioneered in the mid-'60s by the Byrds, who played Bob Dylan songs as if they were from the British Invasion. The Byrds established the blueprint that many bands followed. As the '60s winded down, more folk-rock groups emphasized the acoustic origins of folk and backed away from the ringing electric arrpeggios of the Byrds. In the next three decades, both the acoustic and electric folk-rock sounds were commonplace in rock & roll.","songs":[{"id":"8GbJjVf93d8","name":"丫头","artist":"J4Ha22d7"},{"id":"b4M8Sd6f2f","name":"Shape of My Heart","artist":"SNxabb6b"},{"id":"d3lgE27a29","name":"The Sound of Silence","artist":"SM3974d9"},{"id":"d2dnQ2a8bf","name":"In My Secret Life","artist":"bVAEr19160d"},{"id":"b125Fa8fe8","name":"9 Crimes","artist":"btJO1bbc0"},{"id":"xLtnRKcf6c2","name":"像风一样自由","artist":"f32b5ea7"},{"id":"gowt0445e3","name":"Angel","artist":"bwi6ebdd6"},{"id":"Kqi7ab814","name":"Desperado","artist":"dOMl45894"},{"id":"f49oX3d802","name":"California Dreamin'","artist":"dyNS3f9a8"},{"id":"b0M55168e4","name":"Heart of Gold","artist":"2Oa4f9b1"},{"id":"cOqfE247d9","name":"Under a Violet Moon","artist":"4nq54ff0"},{"id":"bA15kd70b2","name":"If I Have To Go","artist":"SO5a078e"}],"albums":[{"id":"olSff7f4d","name":"回了又去 去了再回","artist":"J4Ha22d7"},{"id":"8rFh42ecf","name":"Ten Summoner's Tales","artist":"SNxabb6b"},{"id":"DwM8325f","name":"Ten New Songs","artist":"SERde896"},{"id":"b4Umee81d","name":"Sounds of Silence","artist":"SM3974d9"},{"id":"f30I7ab96","name":"爱如少年","artist":"f32b5ea7"},{"id":"iThXaaa6d","name":"9","artist":"btJO1bbc0"},{"id":"gaRf90eeb","name":"在路上……","artist":"f32b5ea7"},{"id":"jgitafa04","name":"Sleep Through the Static","artist":"bwi6ebdd6"},{"id":"ES062332","name":"The Graduate","artist":"SM3974d9"},{"id":"eMZU8d23f","name":"Under a Violet Moon","artist":"4nq54ff0"},{"id":"cKvy2e17e","name":"If You Can Believe Your Eyes a...","artist":"dyNS3f9a8"},{"id":"bdDDe0c06","name":"Desperado","artist":"dOMl45894"}],"artists":[{"id":"f32b5ea7","name":"许巍"},{"id":"c8Hl32a9c","name":"The Beatles"},{"id":"SERde896","name":"Leonard Cohen"},{"id":"SFQbc0bd","name":"Bob Dylan"},{"id":"btJO1bbc0","name":"Damien Rice"},{"id":"dOMl45894","name":"Eagles"},{"id":"e1R531b6","name":"玉置浩二"},{"id":"b5YJ18170","name":"Kim Taylor"},{"id":"SIgc5d19","name":"Led Zeppelin"},{"id":"6oW6c156","name":"John Mayer"},{"id":"2Oa4f9b1","name":"Neil Young"},{"id":"SO5a078e","name":"Tom Waits"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1091","name":"自赏 Shoegazing","description":"自赏（Shoegaze）是指80年代末90年代初的英伦独立音乐的一个流派，之所以叫做自赏是源于这些乐队的一动不动的舞台表演风格，当这些乐队在舞台上表演时只盯着舞台地板就好比一直盯着自己的鞋子，Shoegazing 即自此而得名。因而有人就把这一类乐队称为“自赏派”。当“自赏派”音乐开始为听众所接受并传播之时，“自赏派”进而特指那些声响吵闹并且冗长而沉闷；乐器充满阵阵的失真和密集的回授效果；歌声和旋律被吉他音响声墙所淹没并无法分辨各种乐器之间音色的音乐。这类风格的代表性乐队有：My Bloody Valentine(血色情书)，Slowdive（慢潜），Medicine(药)，The Jesus and Mary Chain(耶稣玛丽链)，Ride(驾驭)，Lush(繁茂)，The chapterhouse(分会场),等。\n“自赏派”在英国流行乐历史上具有重要地位，“自赏派”那迷人的旋律与巨大的吉他声墙，以及他们我行我素的个性，吸引着无数忠贞的乐迷的喜爱与怀念，尤其是那些不为时尚所惑的角落里的听歌者。\n\n但是千万不要以为自赏就仅仅是从视觉角度进行的定义，它之所以代表一种音乐类型是特指这种音乐的纯粹声响。这种音乐往往带给你的是不可抗拒的喧吵并伴随着长时间低沉单调的吉他回复、扭曲失真的声波和一系列吉他回馈的层叠，人声和旋律消弥于吉他声墙中，营造出一种你完全分辨不出各种乐器音色的音乐冲击。大部分的自赏乐队的音乐都以 My Blood Valentine 乐队音乐为模板，My Blood Valetine 曾以早期的 EP 和第一张专辑 《Isn’t Anything》 确立了 Shoegazing 的基本音乐模式，其他诸如 Dinosaur Jr., the Jesus & Mary Chain, 和 Cocteau Twins 这些乐队也对此种音乐有主要影响。后来跟进的乐队，像大家熟知的 Ride、Lush、ChapterHouse 和 the Boo Radleys 都在固有的音乐模式下加入了自己的特色，如 Ride 就加入了 60 年代迷幻乐元素，而 Lush 则结合了介于流行乐和 Cocteau Twins 似的梦幻流行乐（Dream Pop）之间的音乐元素。　　没有一支自赏乐队是做动态表演的，而且对媒体采访也不感兴趣，正因这些阻止了这些英国乐队进入重要的美国市场。在这些乐队占据英国音乐媒体和排行榜达 3 年之久后的 1992 年，经过美国的 Grunge 和英国由 Suede 乐队始作俑者的 Britpop 这两次浪潮，自赏乐队不再被公众给予关注，有些乐队（如ChapterHouse、Ride）几年内便宣告解散，而另外一些乐队（如 the Boo Radleys 和 Lush）则与时俱进得以延续至今。\n\nShoegazing (also known as shoegaze) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged from the United Kingdom in the late 1980s. It lasted there until the mid 1990s, with a critical zenith reached in 1990 and 1991. The British music press—particularly NME and Melody Maker—named this style shoegazing because the musicians in these bands stood relatively still during live performances in a detached, introspective, non-confrontational state, hence the idea that they were gazing at their shoes. The heavy use of effects pedals also contributed to the image of performers looking down at their feet during concerts.\n\nThe shoegazing sound is typified by significant use of guitar effects, and indistinguishable vocal melodies that blend into the creative noise of the guitars. A general description given to shoegazing and other affiliated bands in London in the early 1990s was The Scene That Celebrates Itself. In the early 1990s, shoegazing groups were pushed aside by the American grunge movement and early Britpop acts such as Suede, forcing the relatively unknown bands to break up or reinvent their style altogether.  Recent times have seen a renewed interest in the genre among \"nu-gaze\" bands.\n\nShoegazing (or shoegaze, originally interchangeable with \"dream pop\") is a subgenre of indie and alternative rock that emerged in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s. Its sound is characterised by an ethereal mixture of obscured vocals, guitar distortion and effects, feedback, and overwhelming volume. The term \"shoegazing\" was coined by the British music press to ridicule the stage presence of a wave of neo-psychedelic groups who stood still during live performances in a detached, introspective, non-confrontational state with their heads down. This was because the heavy use of effects pedals meant the performers were often looking down at the readouts on their effects pedals during concerts.\n\nMost shoegaze bands drew from the stylistic template set by My Bloody Valentine on their early EPs and 1988 debut Isn't Anything. A loose label given to the shoegazing scene and other affiliated bands in London in the early 1990s was The Scene That Celebrates Itself. In the early 1990s, shoegazing groups were pushed aside by the American grunge movement and early Britpop acts such as Suede, forcing the relatively unknown bands to break up or reinvent their style altogether. In the 2000s, there was renewed interest in the genre among \"nu gaze\" bands.\nShoegaze combines ethereal, swirling vocals with layers of distorted, bent, flanged guitars,[4] creating a wash of sound where no instrument is distinguishable from another. Most bands drew from the music of My Bloody Valentine as a template for the genre,although co-founder Kevin Shields stated that the band's choice of pedals never included chorus, flanger or delay effects.","songs":[{"id":"UoUO1075b","name":"Agoraphobia","artist":"bwoUe802c"},{"id":"eW1SU36c0d","name":"Lust","artist":"6pb89a8b"},{"id":"mQAl817977e","name":"Into

Rock（视觉摇滚），是受欧美华丽摇滚（Glam Rock）和新浪漫的影响80年代末在日本创立的，以华丽夸张的化妆造型著称，其音乐形式以流行类摇滚及极具性格的实验性音乐为主但大部分后逐步转向商业化音乐。\n\n现在，日本出现的摇滚乐队特别是视觉系摇滚乐队很受欢迎。他们以夸张的化妆造型表及狂野激烈的舞台表演，来表达他们对音乐的看法。演唱会是那些视觉摇滚乐队诠释他们的音乐世界的最佳场合。 那么华丽摇滚就是视觉系摇滚吗？ 70年代末，在欧美出现了以DAVIDBOWIE为代表的“华丽摇滚”。华丽摇滚将视觉的要素引入了摇滚中，以华丽的装扮和现场演奏为特征。80年代初，在日本的千叶出现了一个叫X-JAPAN的乐队。他们继承了欧美80年代重金属的风格，同时更借鉴欧美摇滚的重妆并伴随着日本的民族性将其演化发扬成一种独特的造型美学——从此“视觉系”诞生。之后视觉系在日本逐渐发展壮大，而且曲风也越来越多元化，视觉系那种独特的美学和标新立异的视觉效果成了日本音乐界一大亮色，给日本摇滚界以极大的冲击赢得了无数歌迷的青睐。LunaSea，MaliceMizer,DirEnGrey……不断涌现的视觉系乐队不但在音乐性方面达到高水准，他们更将自己的个性融合到造型和装扮中，表现出超出音乐范畴的深层理念。这使得视觉系在日本音乐界占据了一个不可动摇的位置。\n\nヴィジュアル系 (ヴィジュアルけい) とは、日本のロックバンド及びミュージシャンの様式の一つである。「ビジュアル系」とも表記され、「V系」（ぶいけい）とも呼ばれる。過激で派手な化粧や髪型、衣装などの外見が最大の特徴。X JAPAN、COLOR、D'ERLANGERら1989年以降にデビューした装飾美バンドを主としてカテゴライズされたもので、それらの影響を強く受けた後の世代のバンドをも指す。\n\n音楽的な特徴\n\nどのバンドも基本的にはロックであり、ハードロックを基本としたヘヴィメタル及びポップロックが主流である。全体的に暗く激しい曲調にマイナー調の流麗なメロディーを乗せたものを好む傾向が強い。\n黎明期のバンドには、エクスタシー系のX JAPANやLUNA SEA、ZI:KILLなど、ヘヴィメタルやハードロックを基礎にゴスやニューロマンティックに多い耽美で退廃的な歌詞を載せて歌っているバンドや、D'ERLANGERのようなビート・ロック的な物、フリーウィル系レーベルを中心としたCOLOR、かまいたち等の反抗的で反社会的な歌詞を含むパンク系とそれぞれが一定の勢力を保っていた。\n1990年代中後期に爆発的に増えたバンドには黒夢やLUNA SEAからの影響を受けた者が多く、その後、21世紀に入ってからはムード歌謡やミクスチャー・ロックなどの音楽要素を含むスタイルが流行した。\n歌詞の傾向としては「内省的」「自虐的」「攻撃的」なものが多かった。政治批判など外を向いた主張は少なく、より身近なものに対する反発や悲恋歌が主であり、基本は暗く陰湿なものが王道と解釈されていた。しかし、1997年に歌謡曲のカバーでヒットしたSHAZNAによって世間一般のもつヴィジュアル系という認識が従来のイメージとはかけ離れた色物的な集団として捉えられた。2001年にはcali≠gariなどの昭和歌謡的メロディや独特の言葉遊びの歌詞を特徴とするバンドが出現し、大きなセールスにはつながらなかったがのちに多くのフォロワーを生み出した。2006年は歌詞・音楽ともに王道と言われた傾向は影を潜めている。なお、1990年代流行時のヴィジュアル系バンドの中には、何故か暗黙の了解として「下ネタ禁止」というものもあったが、これについては黎明期のヴィジュアル系バンドとの相違点として指摘する者も少なくない。ただし、DIR EN GREYのように官能美を楽曲のテーマに取り入れるバンドもあった。 Janne Da Arcなどは一部楽曲で官能的な表現を使うことがあるが、あくまで女性視点からの作詞で、下品に聞こえないようにされている。\nマーティ・フリードマンによれば、日本のヴィジュアル系はX JAPANの功績によって、一般的に広く認知され、曲調に関してもヘヴィメタルを基軸にしながらもその実は非常に広い音楽性の幅を持っているという。本来、ひとりの人間が好む曲調はある程度の幅に収まるはずであるがX JAPANは「Silent Jealousy」のような超攻撃的・超高速の曲から「Say Anything」のような美しいバラードまで発表しており、ファンもそれを受け入れている。それはX JAPANがその外見と共にサウンドもブランドとして確立した証拠であるとしている。","songs":[{"id":"eqcbl2ebe4","name":"ENDLESS RAIN","artist":"hcy99b3f"},{"id":"jUHvcfafb","name":"Evergreen","artist":"gYz9def2"},{"id":"VlZa53b50","name":"スピカ

Pop","description":"“巴洛克流行”音乐出现于60年代中期，其时，包括“the Left Banke”、“the Beach Boys”在内的艺人、制作人Phil Spector、以及作曲家／编排家Burt Bacharach，所有这些来自各方的人士开始将“古典”（Classic）音乐元素融入到“摇滚”（Rock）乐中，从而达到一种远离“摇滚”乐狂野、原始根源的雄伟的管弦乐之声。\n\n层次化的和声、弦乐与号声都是“巴洛克流行”音乐的标记，还有音乐中戏剧性的（感情）强烈程度。\n\n在“巴洛克流行”音乐的起初阶段，它是截止当时的“摇滚”乐最成熟的衍生物，并且其精神继续存在于各种音乐形式中——从70年代早期的“费城灵魂”（Philly Soul）之声到相似的90年代中期的“室内流行”（Chamber Pop）之声。\n分层的协调，排列和喇叭是所有巴洛克流行的特点，具有强烈音乐戏剧性的，生动的特点。\n在它刚开始形成的时候，它是摇滚成熟的产物，它的灵魂是建立在Philly所有70年代早期的思想到90年代中期chamber pop的思想上的。\n\nBaroque Pop is a style that arose in the mid-1960s when artists such as The Beach Boys, The Left Banke, The Zombies, and producer Phil Spector began adding classical instruments such as strings and horns to their music; thus creating a more majestic, dramatic sound.\n\nBaroque Pop has undergone a revival in recent years, with Indie Pop artists such as The Decemberists and Belle and Sebastian drawing on the template laid down in the 1960s. These modern artists are usually referred to as Chamber Pop, rather than Baroque Pop.\n\nBaroque pop (sometimes called baroque rock) is a fusion genre that combines rock music with particular elements of classical music. It emerged in the mid 1960s as artists pursued a majestic, orchestral sound and is identifiable for its appropriation of Baroque compositional styles (contrapuntal melodies and functional harmony patterns) and dramatic or melancholic gestures. Harpsichords figure prominently, while oboes, French horns, and string quartets are also common.\n\nAlthough harpsichords had been deployed for a number of pop hits since the 1940s, starting in the 1960s, some record producers increasingly placed the instrument in the foreground of their arrangements. Inspired partly by the Beatles' song \"In My Life\" (1965), various groups were appropriating baroque and classical instrumentation by early 1966.The term \"baroque rock\" was coined in promotional material for the Left Banke, who used harpsichords and violins in their arrangements and whose 1966 song \"Walk Away Renée\" exemplified the style.\n\nBaroque pop's mainstream popularity faded by the 1970s, partially because punk rock, disco and hard rock took over; nonetheless, music was still produced within the genre's tradition. Philadelphia soul in the 1970s and chamber pop in the 1990s both incorporated the spirit of baroque pop while the latter contested much of the time's low fidelity musical aesthetic.","songs":[{"id":"b4Fxxd3716","name":"Viva la Vida","artist":"6e095c23"},{"id":"9nVa429ba","name":"Comptine d'un autre été : L'Après midi","artist":"6hF751e3"},{"id":"xLC5gMb6292","name":"Writing's On the Wall","artist":"cOcF1dd24e9"},{"id":"mQQS5k86e81","name":"High by the Beach","artist":"dv4Y34ea9"},{"id":"b08lFb87f9","name":"Waterloo Sunset","artist":"bsIPfd116"},{"id":"b0hW6c8d47","name":"Wouldn't It Be Nice (Mono Version)","artist":"2CD6462a"},{"id":"bf04VCf3399d","name":"出色","artist":"dcICO7d8b86"},{"id":"mQ5I5691e9f","name":"I'd Love To Kill You","artist":"6h57b32d"},{"id":"xLxbMDa6ff9","name":"I'm Going Away Smiling","artist":"SKf9ebec"},{"id":"b0pzsbcea4","name":"La Chanson de Prévert","artist":"2FG70f7a"},{"id":"eNVwu35f3a","name":"When I'm Sixty-Four","artist":"c8Hl32a9c"}],"albums":[{"id":"YDud015c","name":"Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Po...","artist":"6hF751e3"},{"id":"bC6WXnM451a3","name":"Honeymoon","artist":"dv4Y34ea9"},{"id":"bC6XbJ246f92","name":"Writing's On the Wall","artist":"cOcF1dd24e9"},{"id":"w9UA4032a","name":"The House","artist":"6h57b32d"},{"id":"djl73a9c3","name":"Pet Sounds","artist":"2CD6462a"},{"id":"DgM646ac","name":"Sgt.

It's actually hard to say whether new adult contemporary radio formats were created to play this music or whether the music was created for radio airplay.

The genre started in the 1960s. Artists like Yardbirds, Cream, and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers in the UK and The Allman Brothers Band, Canned Heat, and Johnny Winter in the US eventually brought the sound widespread popularity.\n\nBlues rock is a fusion genre combining elements of blues and rock. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock: electric guitar, electric bass, and drums, often with Hammond organ. From its beginnings in the early- to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way it inspired and influenced hard rock, Southern rock, and early heavy metal. Blues rock continues to be an influence in the 2010s, with performances and recordings by popular artists.\nBlues rock started with rock musicians in the United Kingdom and the United States performing American blues songs. They typically recreated electric Chicago-style blues songs, such as those by Muddy Waters, Jimmy Reed, Howlin' Wolf, and Albert King, at faster tempos and with a more aggressive sound common to rock. In the UK, the style was popularized by groups such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Animals, who managed to place blues songs into the pop charts. In the US, Lonnie Mack, the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and Canned Heat were among the earliest exponents and \"attempted to play long, involved improvisations which were commonplace on jazz records\".[3] John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers and Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac also developed this more instrumental, but traditional-based style in the UK, while late 1960s and early 1970s groups, including Ten Years After, Savoy Brown, the Climax Blues Band and Foghat became more hard rock oriented. In the US, Johnny Winter, the Allman Brothers Band, and ZZ Top represented a hard rock trend.","songs":[{"id":"mQGvd889c00","name":"Take Me To Church","artist":"yfWNMrdc983"},{"id":"bBsLIc36cf","name":"Tears in heaven","artist":"SEIbc3e7"},{"id":"b0CxB9ae6c","name":"Stairway to Heaven","artist":"SIgc5d19"},{"id":"cjTzPfd5b4","name":"Ain't No Sunshine","artist":"c9pt3409a"},{"id":"ONUv85f31","name":"The Heart of Life","artist":"6oW6c156"},{"id":"mQQ9nQ805a4","name":"你真有办法","artist":"bWeOzq9071f"},{"id":"b3bl3d3acd","name":"18 and Life","artist":"4o474323"},{"id":"ehWW42eeb8","name":"Highway to Hell","artist":"SDib8104"},{"id":"Luj466756","name":"The Game of Love","artist":"2Kj8b53e"},{"id":"b0lyYd0d54","name":"Lodi","artist":"cYJC3b0c2"},{"id":"8GlV4k17134","name":"青春没有终点","artist":"eaMJ70b1e"},{"id":"b6kngac41f","name":"Satisfaction","artist":"2JV625ce"}],"albums":[{"id":"bYo5yf6c246","name":"Hozier","artist":"yfWNMrdc983"},{"id":"jLQVdc390","name":"Clapton Chronicles：The Best Of...","artist":"SEIbc3e7"},{"id":"Dub80a44","name":"Slowhand","artist":"SEIbc3e7"},{"id":"bem6c898b","name":"Led Zeppelin IV","artist":"SIgc5d19"},{"id":"8YfUYhe2dec","name":"谁都不伟大","artist":"bWeOzq9071f"},{"id":"Oui7bef0","name":"Bring 'Em In","artist":"c9pt3409a"},{"id":"vHi1260a4","name":"Continuum","artist":"6oW6c156"},{"id":"DbJ5fc46","name":"Back in Black","artist":"SDib8104"},{"id":"jp2fa5f3b","name":"Forty Licks","artist":"2JV625ce"},{"id":"eNuo852d7","name":"Skid Row","artist":"4o474323"},{"id":"bdcCc799a","name":"Highway to Hell","artist":"SDib8104"},{"id":"bdvhb656d","name":"Unplugged","artist":"SEIbc3e7"}],"artists":[{"id":"SIgc5d19","name":"Led Zeppelin"},{"id":"SDib8104","name":"AC/DC"},{"id":"Tmp9be73","name":"B.B.

It has been extremely prolific since the early 1970s and can be seen as a key foundation of the development of highly successful mainstream Celtic bands and popular musical performers, as well as creating important derivatives through further fusions. It has played a major role in the maintenance and definition of regional and national identities and in fostering a pan-Celtic culture. It has also helped to communicate those cultures to external audiences.","songs":[{"id":"gndnZ47896","name":"Never Grow Old","artist":"3xzc5875"},{"id":"UuA46a9f3","name":"Dirty Old Town","artist":"SKca460c"},{"id":"b7Bo5c5a5f","name":"Time Is Like a Promise","artist":"ABn8885c"},{"id":"mQEjLF52472","name":"Rose Tattoo","artist":"biNzb7e1f"},{"id":"xLsTmOa6767","name":"Tri martolod","artist":"V6q9e6b1"},{"id":"chaam19555","name":"Stranded","artist":"cYN9398c8"},{"id":"8GbSimfa704","name":"Imagine","artist":"3Sv8ddfd"},{"id":"b3BfM988e8","name":"How Long Will I Love You?","artist":"T0Had323"},{"id":"8Gi2dr1ccb0","name":"I Believe It","artist":"9Dx7286b"},{"id":"ch7ns16fb4","name":"Strange Day in the Country","artist":"57f87631"},{"id":"MDNP8b98b","name":"Libertango","artist":"56p4c218"},{"id":"mQFBYg85fd7","name":"I Can See Clearly Now","artist":"btKbe3065"}],"albums":[{"id":"eCF86d84c","name":"Wake Up and Smell the Coffee","artist":"3xzc5875"},{"id":"7ZGK40456","name":"Bury the Hatchet","artist":"3xzc5875"},{"id":"eCF35e7c8","name":"Everybody Else Is Doing It, So...","artist":"3xzc5875"},{"id":"eCF56a374","name":"To the Faithful Departed","artist":"3xzc5875"},{"id":"beBP9dcc6","name":"Rum Sodomy & the Lash","artist":"SKca460c"},{"id":"E0y5ce09","name":"Magic Time","artist":"cYN9398c8"},{"id":"jXHxaf103","name":"Bualadh Bos: The Cranberries L...","artist":"3xzc5875"},{"id":"kLfNa108b","name":"Signed and Sealed in Blood","artist":"biNzb7e1f"},{"id":"nBczea9e7","name":"Tir Na Nog","artist":"ABn8885c"},{"id":"4ZjW3b743","name":"The Imagine Project","artist":"bsUxf525b"},{"id":"oGre182bf","name":"失落的机械城","artist":"nelZ16af9"},{"id":"ggOo567b7","name":"The Ultimate Collection","artist":"SKca460c"}],"artists":[{"id":"3xzc5875","name":"The Cranberries"},{"id":"dOPU771f8","name":"Sinéad O'Connor"},{"id":"6f251005","name":"Dolores O'Riordan"},{"id":"cYN9398c8","name":"Van Morrison"},{"id":"SKca460c","name":"The Pogues"},{"id":"biNzb7e1f","name":"Dropkick Murphys"},{"id":"FnQ64ee2","name":"Annwn"},{"id":"T0Had323","name":"The Waterboys"},{"id":"HbG81f85","name":"The Elders"},{"id":"ABn8885c","name":"Tir Na Nog"},{"id":"deOY39955","name":"Fiddler's Green"},{"id":"byFt1dd5b","name":"Afro Celt Sound System"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3269","name":"中国摇滚 Chinese Rock","description":"暂无","songs":[{"id":"8IJmvR16db0","name":"电视","artist":"yi0NkSd13de"},{"id":"b7ZSRa7d7b","name":"DJ Wordy vs. Martin Atkins","artist":"b1m91c1b8"},{"id":"mSCv1A71bb6","name":"Poem of Death","artist":"jAL4f03ec85"},{"id":"mSDVlhb5fde","name":"Ready to Go","artist":"rmWp1e97c"}],"albums":[{"id":"8xR95dd6","name":"垃圾场","artist":"B5d1a41"},{"id":"yhYmztc57cf","name":"虫人","artist":"JXPUAZ2360c"},{"id":"yhWuf6d4e73","name":"乌鲁木齐","artist":"yi0NkSd13de"},{"id":"9cHs4Mffe3b","name":"32天","artist":"yi0NkSd13de"},{"id":"1txsSX9e862","name":"一见喜","artist":"yiuPBGacb26"},{"id":"qyEgU68dc52","name":"堂口","artist":"N6v8d643"},{"id":"qyCAxg6a5d5","name":"猫甜","artist":"dHWbybfe4f4"},{"id":"b4NWtoz43037","name":"蛆群","artist":"no5vYp58273"},{"id":"biYyVOv30f2a","name":"劝君","artist":"yiuPBGacb26"},{"id":"yhR1ueb22c7","name":"Overload","artist":"jAL4f03ec85"},{"id":"fpwI81cec","name":"Made in China","artist":"b1m91c1b8"},{"id":"nngGJO50458","name":"11:11","artist":"yiurbHa93c1"}],"artists":[{"id":"B5d1a41","name":"何勇"},{"id":"i8Ye4ab0","name":"面孔"},{"id":"fT1aff8c","name":"病蛹"},{"id":"i3Tf5d7b","name":"Ado"},{"id":"no5vYp58273","name":"蛇山"},{"id":"yi2ksd15dfa","name":"离溪乐队"}]},{"type":"style","id":"685","name":"学院摇滚 College Rock","description":"本质上来说，学院摇滚是很大型的另类音乐，它在80年代（大约1983-84）中通过college radio playlists中占据优势。大部分的学院摇滚是在新潮，后朋克和早期的另类摇滚的混合中产生的。学院摇滚要求乐队不能像新浪潮一样去适应主流；尽管它可能是艺术的，但它又不同于试验或是分离的后朋克；并且在早期另类摇滚和美国地下根源于的朋克和硬核，并不是所有的学院摇滚都重复着一过程。（虽然，很多早期的另类乐队很精确的适应了这种风格）。早期的学院摇滚中两大最具影响力的乐队是R.E.M 和the Smiths，他们为无数美国（the DBs, Lets Active）和英国（Housemartins, Las ）jangly guitar-pop的开拓者展现了一条光明大路。但是学院摇滚还包括了很多的东西：萌芽阶段的前硬核风格的美国地下（SonicYouth, the Minutemen, the Mear Puppets, Dinosaur Jr., the Replacements）；离奇的英国流行在新浪潮中的幸存者XTC和Robyn Hitchcock；类似离奇的美国乐队如They Might Be Giants, the Violent Femmes, Camper Van Beathoven和the Pixies；有内涵的民谣摇滚（Billy Bragg, the Waterboys和10,000 Maniacs）；加入了很多流行元素在音乐中的后朋克（the Cure, Siouxsie & Banshees）；以电子合成器为基础的忧郁的舞曲流行，好自省的歌词（New Order, Depeche Mode）；和带有轻微流行，制造出使耳朵爆裂的快速吉他噪音（the Pixies, the Jesus & Mary Chain）。学院摇滚还包括了像U2, Peter Gabriel, Sting这样少数的主流明星，他们有思想的歌词以及社会意识的唯心论使他们在校园中广为流行。学院摇滚意义上的全盛期伴随着1991年Nirvana的突破而结束，它为那些主流的耳朵拓宽了更多关于另类流行的理解；如college radio playlists开始像商业的alternative radio, 更多另类音乐的实验分支以及独立摇滚在地下更被驱策地向前发展。\n\nCollege rock was the alternative rock music played on student-run university and college campus radio stations located in the United States and Canada in the 1980s.

Key bands in this genre include DMZ, The Fuzztones and Lyres. The scene was never particularly commercially successful, but it gained a strong underground following. \n\nPrimarily led by The Strokes, The Hives, The Vines and The White Stripes, the early 2000s saw an explosion in Garage Rock influenced indie rock bands. These so-called 'garage rock revival' bands included other influences into the sound, such as Post-Punk, New Wave and Punk Rock. This revival was far more popular than the 80s revival and the original genre. This popularity helped the genre become a significant force in guitar music throughout the decade, with artists such as Kings of Leon, Arctic Monkeys and The Libertines all being influenced.","songs":[{"id":"bAs52bf34f","name":"Whistle For The Choir  ","artist":"bM7z215e9"},{"id":"OgsY7bbf2","name":"Seven Nation Army","artist":"T5Ubd553"},{"id":"mQ8inc7bb01","name":"Future

Rock），在最早期，摇滚强调的是容易的常包含着同样易记歌词的悦耳曲调。然而那不是经常的情形，假如曲调是足够的坚固，那么摇滚乐器就要理解并且开始打击。这种现象最常发生于在摇滚刚出现的十年里面，它在英国入侵之前建立了一种器乐摇滚的黄金时代。这种以打击乐器导向的曲调能够强调管风琴（the Tornados “Telstar”）或是萨克斯管(the Champs “Tequila”)，但是大部分时候它是以吉他为主的，如Duane Eddy的拨弦声，Link Wray内部模糊的音质，Ventures清晰摘取的反应，这些都对许多后来跟随于其后(Eddy 和the Ventures同样获得了相当多的单曲上的成功)的摇滚吉他乐手造成了一个极大的影响。The Ventures尤其受到了发展浪潮音乐的影响，它---除了一些像the Beach Boys 和Jan & Dean的组合---经常有重回音吉他乐器组成。尽管这种快速激情的挑选和中东的衡量有时被浪潮吉他的改革者Dick Dale借用，大部分浪潮音乐是相当简单，保留了它曲调的重点。在英国入侵之后，器乐敲打主要被限制于R & B领域，其中的乐手如Booker T. & the MGs 和萨克斯管手Junior Walker。疯克和disco在70年代创作了一些乐器打击单曲，并且许多艺术摇滚乐手技术上的艺术鉴别力使它的乐迷珍视器乐的演奏，即使大部分的歌曲是以一个或其他的要点为代表的。这种强调技术上的技巧延续到了80年代，当受过高等训练的吉他鉴赏家开始在重金属中占有支配地位，甚至开始录制他们的个人专辑。在90年代，器乐音乐造成了在独立摇滚团体中的复原，在eclectic, avant-garde post-rock团体如Tortoise的领导下，浪潮摇滚复兴运动者如Man or Astro-Man也是一样的。\n\nInstrumental rock is a type of rock music which emphasizes musical instruments, and which features very little or no singing.\nExamples of

Rock","description":"爵士摇滚最早出现在60年代末期，它试图将摇滚所拥有的发自内心的力量与爵士所拥有的音乐复杂性和即兴表演融合起来。由于摇滚通常强调的是直接和简单而不是精湛的技巧，因而大体上可以说，爵士摇滚的来源是60年代末70年代初，那些在追求艺术上最有野心的摇滚亚流派：迷幻剂、前卫摇滚、以及歌手/歌曲作者运动。\n\n它融合了爵士乐更老练、更理智的一面，并常在乐器的即席创作中加入人声；此种学派的代表人物包括Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, 和 Tim Buckle. 尽管如此，大部分爵士摇滚仍是由那些精力更为旺盛的摇滚团体来演奏的。他们中的一些是以即兴演奏为方向的，被他们扩展了的带有摇滚口味的即席创作充分借助了爵士乐中的和声及乐器，代表乐队是Traffic和Santana. 其它一些记录在案的带有爵士风味的R&B或流行乐队还有Blood, Sweat & Tears, Chicago和Steely Dan，他们运用了爵士乐中旋律性强、使用和声、富有节奏等特性，但对于即兴演奏和乐器使用上的技巧却不感兴趣。另外还有一些乐队，他们运用了爵士的复杂性来进一步扩展摇滚的音乐界限，不仅表现在器械技巧方面，还包括创作离奇的、令人深思的、难以预料的音乐作品，比如Frank Zappa和the Soft Machine. 而其中最主要的人物就是Miles Davis，他是自早期的R&B开始觊觎摇滚朴实的力量并对年轻的听众造成一定影响之后的第一个爵士音乐家。从“1970s Bitches Brew”开始，Davis70年代早期的作品 -- 其中大部分灵感来源于Jimi Hendrix和 Sly & the Family Stone -- 迅速成为爵士摇滚唱片中最疯克、最边缘、最前卫的那部分。尽管像Zappa 和 Steely Dan这类的人物在整个70年代都一直在灌制爵士摇滚的唱片，但到80年代，这场运动从本质上说已经消散，它的听众也被爵士摇滚其它更为成熟的音乐形式所俘获。 \n\nJazz-rock may refer to the loudest, wildest, most electrified fusion bands from the jazz camp, but most often it describes performers coming from the rock side of the equation. Jazz-rock first emerged during the late '60s as an attempt to fuse the visceral power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational fireworks of jazz. Since rock often emphasized directness and simplicity over virtuosity, jazz-rock generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late '60s and early '70s: psychedelia, progressive rock, and the singer/songwriter movement. The latter drew from the mellower, more cerebral side of jazz, often employing vocal as well as instrumental improvisation; this school's major figures included Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, and Tim Buckley. Most jazz-rock, however, was played by higher-energy rock ensembles. Some of them were more jam-oriented, borrowing jazz harmonies and instruments for their extended, rock-flavored improvisations (Traffic, Santana). Others recorded jazz-flavored R&B or pop songs that used the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic sensibilities of jazz, but weren't as interested in improvisation or instrumental virtuosity (Blood, Sweat & Tears, Chicago, Steely Dan). Still others used jazz's complexity to expand rock's musical horizons, not just in terms of instrumental technique but in crafting quirky, challenging, unpredictable compositions (Frank Zappa, the Soft Machine). The major exception was Miles Davis, the first jazz musician since the early R&B era to covet the earthy power of rock & roll and the impact it had on young audiences. Starting with 1970's Bitches Brew, Davis' early-'70s fusion workouts -- greatly inspired by Jimi Hendrix and Sly & the Family Stone -- quickly became some of the funkiest, edgiest, most aggressive jazz-rock ever recorded. While figures like Zappa and $Steely Dan| continued to record jazz-rock through the '70s, the movement had essentially dissipated by the '80s, as a mellower form of fusion captured its audience.","songs":[{"id":"bAB4Ab29e7","name":"Vincent","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"Luj466756","name":"The Game of Love","artist":"2Kj8b53e"},{"id":"d6K3Z26eb0","name":"Night Train","artist":"6ub98531"},{"id":"mQ6I155d896","name":"Sidewalk Cafe","artist":"KMD70c77"},{"id":"b1rYnnD3c5bf","name":"我要开花","artist":"fU8978e1"},{"id":"b0ilO97d77","name":"Cause We've Ended as Lovers","artist":"SDCb7410"},{"id":"chtmrfe4e5","name":"Dirty Work","artist":"ciPX26069"},{"id":"8HQsfnf2ae8","name":"ユメマカセ","artist":"dE8O3e9d6"},{"id":"Le9K5f316","name":"Someone Like You","artist":"cYN9398c8"},{"id":"cgtgRf27f8","name":"Peaches en Regalia","artist":"ciRD27262"},{"id":"b9Y48b669b","name":"Statesboro Blues","artist":"2Cr8c7ef"},{"id":"cMjiO601e0","name":"I.G.Y.","artist":"c8JL2ec31"}],"albums":[{"id":"f6ob4e910","name":"Joanna & 王若琳","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"fJxg58d38","name":"大人故事书 亚洲巡回演唱会影音全纪录","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"EOP63b45","name":"Shaman","artist":"2Kj8b53e"},{"id":"EOB95f89","name":"Supernatural","artist":"2Kj8b53e"},{"id":"zTNr3316d","name":"Supply and Demand","artist":"6ub98531"},{"id":"fSDt7a250","name":"Fantasia","artist":"KMD70c77"},{"id":"f6iY6b63a","name":"Ultimate Santana","artist":"2Kj8b53e"},{"id":"9c92naff3d1","name":"House of Bullies","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"keHjb09e6","name":"Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Gu...","artist":"2Kj8b53e"},{"id":"bfb6b5835","name":"Can't Buy a Thrill","artist":"ciPX26069"},{"id":"USiQca2ad14","name":"我要开花","artist":"fU8978e1"},{"id":"Dux445c31","name":"Emotion & Commotion","artist":"SDCb7410"}],"artists":[{"id":"SR8dda81","name":"Miles Davis"},{"id":"2Kj8b53e","name":"Santana"},{"id":"ciRD27262","name":"Frank Zappa"},{"id":"cYN9398c8","name":"Van Morrison"},{"id":"dz4Z4154c","name":"Morphine"},{"id":"SKpd155b","name":"Procol Harum"},{"id":"dyKe43517","name":"Chicago"},{"id":"2LW7ee68","name":"Soft Machine"},{"id":"dZRDonffd09","name":"ゲスの極み乙女。"},{"id":"ciPX26069","name":"Steely Dan"},{"id":"SEq9b8e9","name":"Tim Buckley"},{"id":"SRK120fe","name":"Al di Meola"}]},{"type":"style","id":"246","name":"德国前卫摇滚 Krautrock","description":"Krautrock为一英国乐评人发明的专有名词，泛指七十年从德国蹦出来，有别於英美风格的前卫摇滚乐团。他们就像当年的嘻皮一样，偏爱迷幻奇想、没事就来个十几二十分落落长的即兴，特别是在摇滚乐中加入革命性的电声实验，营造太空冥想氛围。至於为什么叫Krautrock我也不知道，Kraut本意为德国酸泡菜，也是对德国人的鄙称，也有人说Kraut和英文的herb一样有大麻的意思，指这些玩psychedelic的大麻味很重，还有人说是从 Faust IV这张专辑的第一首歌名「Krautrock」来的，反正众说纷纭，只好随便听听。\n\n　　七十年代的德国年轻人吸收了来自大西洋两岸的摇滚乐文化，例如：爱玩火的Jimi Hendrix鬼魅般的吉他演奏，The Velvet Underground的地下实验精神，Pink Floyd充满的诗意的概念专辑，还有开始玩迷幻的B头四(著名的「胡椒军槽寂寞芳心俱乐部乐队」)。他们并非一成不变的把别人的东西抠过来，而是在摇滚乐中融合了极微主义的编曲概念，延续前辈Karlheinz Stockhausen的电声实验，大量地使用电子合成乐器，唱起了摇滚四件式的挽歌(如果没有他们，Roland、Korg等做电子乐器的老板可能要来台湾摆地摊了)。这些Krautrock先驱们，把高高在上的现代音乐理论拖进摇滚乐这滩混水，发挥科学家般的实验精神，改革传统摇滚乐架构，吉他拿来做噪音，主唱用ㄍㄞ的，鼓手不打4/4拍了，甚至完全就改用才刚开始起步的电子乐器，每个乐团都创造出自己独特的音乐风格，Krautrock可以说是最具「前卫」感的摇滚乐。\n\n　　krautrock乐团皆发迹於德国的大城市，不约而同地带起了这股潮流，经由英国乐评人的推波助澜，Can、Faust、Kraftwerk、 Tangerine Dream…等一个个变成了经典传奇团，甚至连摇滚变色龙David Bowie、不太会弹keybaord的环境音乐大师Brian Eno等人还跨海到德国去向这些人取经(不过这股Krautrock风潮只是发生在英国乐评人的笔下，当时德国本土并没有引起很大的回应，而现今对 Krautrock最著迷的除了英国外，排第二的就是日本了吧)。\n\n　　严格说起来，Krautrcok只是一个统称，绝对不是一种单纯的音乐类型。背负著Krautrock之名的几个乐团其实在音乐本质上有很大的不同： Amon Düül把progressive rock玩的更酸、更涩。Ash Ra Temple主打漫无边际、天马行空的吉他solo。Guru Guru在把玩instrumental rock之余，也会来段长篇迷幻奇想。Neu!则完全是Stereolab早期学习模仿的对象。Faust被誉为德国的The Velvet Underground，又麻又辣的droning嗡嗡噪音，总是会让人沉迷在那种神秘性的节奏中。而Krautrock中团员年龄最老却最funky的 Can，在现场即兴时，经常激发出惊人爆发力。Kraftwerk完全舍弃了传统摇滚乐器，利用电子合成乐器演奏出流行的曲调，专辑概念充满冷酷的机器人、电脑、现代化大都市。Cluster的电子乐则做出一片Ambient太空音效。Klaus Schulze、Tangerine Dream在实验电子一途外另辟New Age大道。另外，融合印度、中南美原住民的音乐元素的Popol Vuh，则充满神秘主义味道，追求原始宗教般的古老仪式。\n\n　　总而言之，Krautrock在七十年代大放异彩，现在这些团现在散的散，单飞的单飞，重组的重组，做出来的东西也都没有早年来的有原创性了。虽然 Krautrock还没被诊断为性无能，却在最近兴起的Post Rock中找到了第二春。Stereolab、Tortoise等后摇滚名团抓著Krautrock尾巴，重现Analogue乐器的风采。许多Post Rock乐团重复性的极微编曲概念、加入的电子音效，主唱不唱歌制造气氛，都可看出是从Krautrock的实验报告那抄来的。而其他Space Rock、Noise Pop、Ambient…等也同样受到Krautrock深远的影响。Sonic Youth的Lee Ranaldo曾预言Krautrock会再度兴起，前几年Faust复出、Kraftwerk登上Spin史上最伟大的50个乐团、Julian Cope写了本Krautrocksampler、Krautrock的早年经典唱片一再复刻、致敬专辑一堆…。\n\n\"Krautrock\" is a term coined by the British music press, and is generally used to refer to the progressive and experimental groups of late 1960s and early 1970s Germany.\n\nThese groups combined a variety of influences and styles, including British and American Psychedelic Rock groups, the Free Jazz of Ornette Coleman and Albert Ayler, and experimental classical composers (most notably Karlheinz Stockhausen as well as the minimalists Terry Riley and Steve Reich). The desire to eschew conventional song structure and melody also led to some groups developing a more mechanical sound and feel for their compositions, which also often made use of early synthesizers and other electronic instrumentation.\n\nAlthough they all differed in their approach to their music, the underlying link between all the krautrock groups was the attempt to take the rhythm (\"motorik\" was the name given to the steady 4/4 beat used by many groups) and energy of American rock music and disassociate it as much as possible from its Rhythm & Blues roots, instead drawing inspiration from other sources.\n\nKraftwerk are far and away the most commercially successful of all the krautrock groups, finding major commercial success when they developed their sound into a pioneering form of Synth Pop combining catchy synthesizer melodies with the motorik rhythm. Critically, however, many krautrock groups are held in high esteem by the vast majority of commentators. Albums by groups such as Amon Düül II, Can, Faust, NEU!, Popol Vuh and Tangerine Dream are regarded as classics in the Experimental Rock and Progressive Rock canon.\n\nIt should be noted that, although \"krautrock\" has come to be accepted as the general term for the music of this style, it was (and is) perceived by some as a xenophobic or derogatory term, since \"kraut\" is an ethnic slur against Germans. As a result, some of the so-called krautrock groups have distanced themselves from the term, instead referring to their music as \"German progressive rock\" or \"Kosmische Musik\".","songs":[{"id":"eNXlW39fd1","name":"Vitamin C","artist":"bIGr252eb"},{"id":"b2SLk14399","name":"The Model","artist":"bts9fb246"},{"id":"NdpU66bf7","name":"Fukken Über Death Party","artist":"3vR7ce76"},{"id":"Kro4b639f","name":"Verwirrung","artist":"SGqca466"},{"id":"b14lca57a6","name":"Hallogallo","artist":"3qY7f1b5"},{"id":"QE2D99815","name":"Flammende Herzen","artist":"Zmlaec62"},{"id":"Mdlv5e058","name":"Ho Renomo","artist":"3qs53005"},{"id":"xLsNHfb1396","name":"If I Could Read Her Mind","artist":"Mt284603"},{"id":"Mx6I53fc2","name":"Light and Darkness: Light - Look at Your Sun","artist":"btOv1a090"},{"id":"L4iu64f18","name":"Pale Gallery","artist":"dPTD47e68"},{"id":"cPA3O20b8d","name":"Ich Mache Einen Spiegel-Dreampart 4","artist":"dPVQ43efd"}],"albums":[{"id":"PWU6e65d","name":"The Man-Machine","artist":"bts9fb246"},{"id":"bdrNc5844","name":"Ege Bamyasi","artist":"bIGr252eb"},{"id":"bpZk9fae8","name":"Neu!

Developing in London nightclubs such as Billy's and The Blitz and spreading to other major cities in the UK, it was based around flamboyant, eccentric fashion and New Wave music. Several music acts from the era adopted the style of the movement and became known to epitomise it within the music and mainstream press, including Ultravox, Visage, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, ABC and Boy George (of Culture Club). Japan and Adam and the Ants were also labelled as New Romantic artists by the press, although they had no direct connection to the original scene. A number of these bands adopted synthesizers and helped to develop synthpop in the early 1980s, which, combined with the distinctive New Romantic visuals, helped them first to national success in the UK and, with help of MTV to play a major part in the Second British Invasion of the U.S. charts. By the mid-1980s, the original movement had largely dissipated and, although some of the artists associated with the scene continued their careers, they had largely abandoned the aesthetics of the movement and the synthpop sound. There were attempts to revive the movement from the 1990s, including the short-lived romo movement.","songs":[{"id":"ciBHRed84e","name":"Forever Young","artist":"3Bpcacd8"},{"id":"b0rDWab242","name":"Don't You Want Me","artist":"SHsb4f9a"},{"id":"K4ZP92aef","name":"True","artist":"SMYc994d"},{"id":"eidkZ2fcc2","name":"Ordinary World","artist":"bsGHe699c"},{"id":"LsH07dcc4","name":"More Than This","artist":"bsLNfa19a"},{"id":"mQ41sQ7fe9c","name":"Fade to Grey","artist":"U1E9ed07"},{"id":"b1igxa224c","name":"Cars","artist":"SJ7ce638"},{"id":"xLrWsva2024","name":"Tainted Love","artist":"SMP2237c"},{"id":"xLqYb4c8fda","name":"Time And Wisdom","artist":"b935f684e"},{"id":"KuO453331","name":"Canton","artist":"2GD707a2"},{"id":"xLoozObe992","name":"The Look of Love","artist":"2Cn7175a"},{"id":"KBJ86e2f2","name":"Vienna","artist":"dyTG3f7cd"}],"albums":[{"id":"eFLQ639bb","name":"Forever Young","artist":"3Bpcacd8"},{"id":"DZ866198","name":"Dare!","artist":"SHsb4f9a"},{"id":"EXA85238","name":"True","artist":"SMYc994d"},{"id":"dZIA48b92","name":"Duran Duran [The Wedding Album...","artist":"bsGHe699c"},{"id":"eaCM6d68a","name":"The Pleasure Principle","artist":"SJ7ce638"},{"id":"beMOb2cc7","name":"Avalon","artist":"bsLNfa19a"},{"id":"jSLGb11bb","name":"Fade To Grey: The Best of Visa...","artist":"U1E9ed07"},{"id":"jI5h9c1c1","name":"Greatests","artist":"bsGHe699c"},{"id":"Edk51339","name":"","artist":"2GD707a2"},{"id":"8R1R428df","name":"The Best of OMD","artist":"TC5c1521"},{"id":"8hACMbf5b33","name":"The Biggest And The Best","artist":"bsGHe699c"},{"id":"4Z8M39b7d","name":"Melancholique","artist":"b935f684e"}],"artists":[{"id":"bsGHe699c","name":"Duran Duran"},{"id":"bsLNfa19a","name":"Roxy Music"},{"id":"SJ7ce638","name":"Gary Numan"},{"id":"SHsb4f9a","name":"The Human League"},{"id":"2GD707a2","name":"Japan"},{"id":"U1E9ed07","name":"Visage"},{"id":"dyTo3c807","name":"Talk Talk"},{"id":"b6Brff168","name":"FrYars"},{"id":"SMP2237c","name":"Soft Cell"},{"id":"SMYc994d","name":"Spandau Ballet"},{"id":"7XD5DLfd237","name":"段同愿"},{"id":"gd6a751f","name":"A Flock Of Seagulls"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3034","name":"钢琴摇滚 Piano Rock","description":"钢琴摇滚（piano rock）是一种以钢琴或诸如电子键盘的类钢琴乐器代替节奏吉他作为伴奏乐器的摇滚乐。在传统意义上，钢琴摇滚远不如经典摇滚知名，但Keane,Coldplay, The Fray, Jack's Mannequin,Muse, Ben Folds Five,The Dresden Dolls, The Whitlams等当代乐队以及Elton John, Tori Amos, Vanessa Carlton, Billy Joel, Kate Bush, Fiona Apple, Rufus Wainwright, Jeff Reinholds, Aqualung等艺人正在逐渐提升这种音乐流派的影响力。\n\n钢琴摇滚首先在1950年代中期浮出水面。当时，钢琴摇滚先锋雷·查尔斯（Ray Charles）和杰瑞·李·刘易斯（Jerry Lee Lewis）等创建了一个新的音乐风格。这种音乐风格与传统摇滚乐的主要区别是——钢琴在摇滚乐起着主要的作用，而不是吉他。现代钢琴摇滚艺人依然延续了这特点。\n每个人都知道摇滚是非常受欢迎的音乐风格，甚至没有人没有听说过摇滚乐的。但实际上，摇滚乐涉及许多不同的风格。所以，你可能会遇到与你的理解不同的“摇滚乐”。在所谓的“经典摇滚”中，一切都围绕着吉他（在大多数情况下是电吉他），当代很多受欢迎的音乐风格都由这种音乐发展而来。但其实钢琴摇滚也是最早的摇滚风格之一，而这种音乐风格是以钢琴等乐器为主。\n\n属于钢琴摇滚音乐风格的音乐家不多，但这种音乐风格仍然很受欢迎。例如，著名歌手多莉·艾莫丝（Tori Amos）使用钢琴作为主要乐器，继承钢琴摇滚先驱的传统。不过当然，当代钢琴摇滚风格的最有名的人物是埃尔顿·约翰（Elton John），许多人认为他是流行艺术家，但他仍然被认为是当代钢琴摇滚的典型代表。\n由钢琴摇滚的先驱创造的钢琴摇滚风格出现在摇滚运动的开始。许多不同的著名人士被视为钢琴摇滚的先驱，但通常只有几位音乐家被视为最主要的钢琴摇滚先驱。\n这些钢琴摇滚先驱是雷·查尔斯，史提夫·汪达（Stevie Wonder），杰瑞·李·刘易斯。他们为钢琴摇滚和许多其他的摇滚和流行风格奠定了基石，他们带来的巨大的灵感浪潮影响了后来许多不同风格的音乐家。\n\n在钢琴摇滚先驱中，最具代表性的人物是雷·查尔斯。他的全名是雷·查尔斯·罗宾逊（Ray Charles Robinson），他出生于1930年9月23日。他5岁时失明，但这一事实并没有妨碍他成为一个著名的音乐家。他在1929年推出了他的第一首热歌“MESS AROUND”并相继推出一系列优秀作品。他很快成为了一位钢琴摇滚偶像——许多现代音乐家承认他们受到过雷·查尔斯的启发。雷·查尔斯获得过格莱美奖等众多音乐奖项，由于在音乐界的巨大贡献（摇滚，灵乐和许多其他的音乐风格），雷·查尔斯入选“爵士名人堂”。尽管他在生活和政治立场方面倍受争议，但他仍然被认为是历史上最伟大的音乐家之一。\n另一位钢琴摇滚先驱的代表艺术家是杰里·李·刘易斯。同雷·查尔斯一样，他是一个伟大的钢琴家，但他同时也是一个曲作家（他的大部分歌曲都是乡村风格的）。他于1935年9月29日出生在美国路易斯安那州。幼年时他家境贫寒，但家人仍贷款给他买了一架旧钢琴。他的第一张唱片于1954年推出，这也是他不凡的音乐生涯的开端。他活跃甚至怪异的表演方式大受欢迎，并受到很多当代钢琴艺人的效仿。他在1986年入选“摇滚名人堂”。\n尽管比以上两位年轻很多，但史提夫·汪达也为钢琴摇滚风格做出了巨大贡献，他的音乐影响了许多当代的R&B艺人。\n\nPiano rock is a style of rock music that is based around the piano—and sometimes piano-related instruments such as keyboards–with piano typically replacing rhythm guitar as the rhythm instrument.

Bands in the post-Britpop era that had been established acts, but gained greater prominence after the decline of Britpop, such as Radiohead and The Verve, and new acts such as Travis, Stereophonics, Feeder and particularly Coldplay, achieved much wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them, and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nMany bands in the post-Britpop era avoided the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. The music of most bands was guitar based, often mixing elements of British traditional rock, particularly the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Small Faces, with American influences. Bands from the era utilized specific elements from 1970s British rock and pop music. Drawn from across the United Kingdom, the themes of their music tended to be less parochially centred on British, English and London life, and more introspective than had been the case with Britpop at its height. This, beside a greater willingness to woo the American press and fans, may have helped a number of them in achieving international success. They have been seen as presenting the image of the rock star as an ordinary person, or \"boy-next-door\" and their increasingly melodic music was criticised for being bland or derivative.","songs":[{"id":"ck84ae64a6","name":"Somewhere Only We Know","artist":"Wfvd0def"},{"id":"b4Fyvbcf88","name":"Yellow","artist":"6e095c23"},{"id":"cgzpgee993","name":"No Surprises","artist":"2J6912ec"},{"id":"L8iW4c93f","name":"Writing to Reach You","artist":"T32d15f9"},{"id":"OJnP53b88","name":"Piece by Piece","artist":"Wktd43c5"},{"id":"cgQ92e5c0c","name":"I Stopped to Fill My Car Up","artist":"btE917a9e"},{"id":"PmVR71eaf","name":"You Held the World in Your Arms","artist":"bwSMf6812"},{"id":"mTeq5I633af","name":"California","artist":"ximsdM9e720"},{"id":"xNAwbZ135a2","name":"日夜循环","artist":"nmS0pQ8a6f9"},{"id":"mTl2rH846c4","name":"王妃","artist":"edEYmge85d1"}],"albums":[{"id":"eTLH6bf8b","name":"Hopes and Fears","artist":"Wfvd0def"},{"id":"beGE98b53","name":"OK Computer","artist":"2J6912ec"},{"id":"jgnYcdace","name":"Parachutes","artist":"6e095c23"},{"id":"nsd8f840e","name":"X&Y","artist":"6e095c23"},{"id":"bUI121128","name":"The Bends","artist":"2J6912ec"},{"id":"CmGM472e9","name":"The Man Who","artist":"T32d15f9"},{"id":"jgupa5e18","name":"Echo Park","artist":"Wktd43c5"},{"id":"eGb375edb","name":"Performance and Cocktails","artist":"btE917a9e"},{"id":"ns3veb048","name":"Comfort in Sound","artist":"Wktd43c5"},{"id":"nnlh0p6bd0e","name":"黄金屋","artist":"edEYmge85d1"},{"id":"nvgAe8485","name":"The Remote Part","artist":"bwSMf6812"},{"id":"CoehWGe8897","name":"迷失","artist":"no5m9Jc5609"}],"artists":[{"id":"6e095c23","name":"Coldplay"},{"id":"Wfvd0def","name":"Keane"},{"id":"T32d15f9","name":"Travis"},{"id":"WENca5d1","name":"Snow Patrol"},{"id":"btE917a9e","name":"Stereophonics"},{"id":"T2Ybeabd","name":"Embrace"},{"id":"Wofe19e0","name":"Starsailor"},{"id":"bwos1ddfc","name":"Bloc Party"},{"id":"6rR737fb","name":"Elbow"},{"id":"W9qc1390","name":"Doves"},{"id":"T2Rb4083","name":"Catatonia"},{"id":"cZijFFbf868","name":"Re-On"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1096","name":"电力流行 Power Pop","description":"Power pop是一种流行的音乐风格，吸收了来自20世纪60年代英国和美国流行音乐和摇滚音乐的灵感。它通常包含一个强劲的旋律，清脆的和声。属于摇滚乐的一种。风格与流行朋克类似，很多乐队的风格是流行朋克与power pop并存的。\n\nPower Pop is a genre that combines pop melodies with loud power chords.

The second originates on the late 1970s and early 1980s with bands such as The Knack, The Beat and The Romantics.

Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues. While there are notable exceptions, its origins lie primarily in the Southern United States.\nThe influence and popularity of the style waned in the 1960s, but during the late 1970s and early 1980s, rockabilly enjoyed a major revival of popularity that endures even now, often within a rockabilly subculture.","songs":[{"id":"mQ8tks6ef68","name":"Heart of Gold","artist":"cjj825adc"},{"id":"gjSQj4b18e","name":"London Calling","artist":"2DS5f307"},{"id":"xLo9a497413","name":"Big Bad Handsome Man","artist":"GyF93e81"},{"id":"b0r5jb82e4","name":"Everyday","artist":"cYLJ3980b"},{"id":"eteyN2ebe8","name":"Blue Suede Shoes","artist":"SJSa0749"},{"id":"Lojp7f8f9","name":"Blue Suede Shoes","artist":"SKia1094"},{"id":"bqvccyv392d0","name":"Funnel Of Love","artist":"c8Le32d9a"},{"id":"cgii2e2dc1","name":"Summertime Blues","artist":"2DU6bd3d"},{"id":"LkYS761c5","name":"Crying","artist":"SJF9f4d8"},{"id":"b4PLwc1719","name":"Stand By Your Man","artist":"TkOc725d"},{"id":"Uf3ye6985","name":"Stray Cat Strut","artist":"2M85a231"},{"id":"b28AN15854","name":"Flyin' Saucer Rock & Roll","artist":"46wb81bf"}],"albums":[{"id":"gbsr76e1f","name":"Unearthed","artist":"cjj825adc"},{"id":"bdwBb7f0d","name":"London Calling","artist":"2DS5f307"},{"id":"jOyV9a0f2","name":"Love Tattoo","artist":"GyF93e81"},{"id":"eafX45f13","name":"Buddy Holly","artist":"cYLJ3980b"},{"id":"jL6md4716","name":"The Fabulous Carl Perkins","artist":"SJSa0749"},{"id":"beC9adbe3","name":"Elvis Presley","artist":"SKia1094"},{"id":"jRpracfee","name":"Queen Of Rockabilly","artist":"c8Le32d9a"},{"id":"wt4e26fa7","name":"Memorial Collection","artist":"cYLJ3980b"},{"id":"kwHTbd4e0","name":"Beyond the Sun","artist":"cvus2c096"},{"id":"xOB5rE10092","name":"我不喜欢结婚","artist":"zBhN2f70d"},{"id":"nVe5f5ed3","name":"The Sun Sessions","artist":"SKia1094"},{"id":"8T212X180b8","name":"Live At Temple Bar","artist":"bkhxdc1a2"}],"artists":[{"id":"cjj825adc","name":"Johnny Cash"},{"id":"SKia1094","name":"Elvis Presley"},{"id":"SDIce1a8","name":"Chuck Berry"},{"id":"SJF9f4d8","name":"Roy Orbison"},{"id":"cYLJ3980b","name":"Buddy Holly"},{"id":"SIna11cc","name":"Little Richard"},{"id":"2Hr5dd5d","name":"Jerry Lee Lewis"},{"id":"2Fkdb28d","name":"The Everly Brothers"},{"id":"c8Le32d9a","name":"Wanda Jackson"},{"id":"SFd9b375","name":"The Cramps"},{"id":"zBhN2f70d","name":"旋转保龄"},{"id":"SJSa0749","name":"Carl Perkins"}]},{"type":"style","id":"327","name":"根源摇滚 Roots Rock","description":"根源摇滚产生于80年代中期，这种音乐所包含的意义就是：回归摇滚最初的形式和精神，也就是5，60年代的摇滚乐。在80年代中期，当金属乐日渐堕落，一些乐手，开始反思什么是真正的音乐，在回顾摇滚乐发展的过程中，人们渐渐认定最伟大的音乐是出现在5,60年代，一个充满鲜花，和平，阳光，自然和爱的时代。 但这种音乐的本质只是崇尚对传统摇滚的回归，而并没有试图去寻找更新的音乐元素，所以在90年代中期以后，几乎再也没有此风格的乐队出现，这种类型的音乐也渐归于沉寂。\n\nRoots rock is rock music that looks back to rock's origins in folk, blues and country music. It is particularly associated with the creation of hybrid sub-genres from the later 1960s including country rock and Southern rock, which have been seen as responses to the perceived excesses of dominant psychedelic and developing progressive rock. Because roots music (Americana) is often used to mean folk and world musical forms, roots rock is sometimes used in a broad sense to describe any rock music that incorporates elements of this music. In the 1980s roots rock enjoyed a revival in response to trends in punk rock, New Wave and heavy metal music.","songs":[{"id":"dCOEb27d2a","name":"Boston","artist":"6kK5e9d4"},{"id":"xL8oFJcb615","name":"This Is the Life","artist":"c4IPYEdeaa7"},{"id":"cqN6ze676a","name":"Wicked Game","artist":"cvus2c096"},{"id":"b4G39df4fb","name":"Love Song; 2: 00 Am","artist":"WjYcb790"},{"id":"KkwO756dd","name":"The Weight","artist":"2C8724b3"},{"id":"UI3y77e0e","name":"Over You","artist":"b5hZff292"},{"id":"cghoZf6a70","name":"Homeless","artist":"ciHi2ac0d"},{"id":"cjU2hf2c59","name":"Happy New Year","artist":"VlIbb651"},{"id":"SQvc8dc7b","name":"The Sun Is Shining Down","artist":"C0J912a7"},{"id":"cgv6lf59be","name":"Jack & Diane","artist":"2HQ7e056"},{"id":"MiRv66f85","name":"There Is a Tree","artist":"5qH5bb4f"},{"id":"xLFcXk9e294","name":"你","artist":"xL64OXaa1c9"}],"albums":[{"id":"DhaQ443f8","name":"Midwest Skies and Sleepless Mo...","artist":"6kK5e9d4"},{"id":"jg0cbdb8f","name":"Boston","artist":"6kK5e9d4"},{"id":"bpJA3qu3868b","name":"Weathered","artist":"c4IPYEdeaa7"},{"id":"eUkk898fe","name":"American Myth","artist":"WjYcb790"},{"id":"eUrc566d2","name":"Can't Love, Can't Hurt","artist":"6kK5e9d4"},{"id":"4Ipv3533d","name":"Heart Shaped World","artist":"cvus2c096"},{"id":"b3hufe0a4","name":"Music from Big Pink","artist":"2C8724b3"},{"id":"yhEweodb0eb","name":"另一个自己","artist":"xL64OXaa1c9"},{"id":"d9w03fe22","name":"To Tulsa and Back","artist":"ciHi2ac0d"},{"id":"yhAGtjd2e54","name":"Gold","artist":"ciHi2ac0d"},{"id":"nnqi8O95076","name":"一天又一天","artist":"yivpj2b61d5"},{"id":"f69f6516d","name":"The Things You Think You Need","artist":"b5hZff292"}],"artists":[{"id":"6kK5e9d4","name":"Augustana"},{"id":"WjYcb790","name":"Jackie Greene"},{"id":"2C8724b3","name":"The Band"},{"id":"WDW9d2da","name":"Joe Strummer / Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros"},{"id":"nmSyNA766e0","name":"和平和浪"},{"id":"cvus2c096","name":"Chris Isaak"},{"id":"2Ec778e3","name":"Ry Cooder"},{"id":"4kA540ef","name":"Izzy Stradlin"},{"id":"45i61f8f","name":"Brian Setzer"},{"id":"BeD86d0a","name":"Lee Rocker"},{"id":"bbrAc0a7f","name":"Alan Vega"},{"id":"TmDa3d23","name":"Delbert McClinton"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1089","name":"悲核 Sadcore","description":"悲核定义\n悲核的音乐性质和结构是简单的——一个鼓，一把贝斯，一把吉他，单纯的LOFI音乐形式。不过，悲核唯一给力的是和声，可以说，悲核里的和声都是非常丰富的。但是，悲核所表达的思想又是复杂的，没有华丽的外表，没有五彩鲜艳的霓裳，这就是悲核。悲核代表了独立音乐的本质。\n\n悲核理解\n悲核，听名字感觉像是悲伤到极致。的确，悲核是一种主观艺术表现形式极高的独立音乐。\n悲核也是一种形式，有句话叫“乐极生悲”，在悲核的音乐里，那这句话的意思应该反过来，就是“悲极生乐”。的确，在悲伤中寻找快乐，会比在快乐中寻找悲伤更加能体现悲剧的力量！\n\n悲核元素\n朋克成分：简单的歌词，随意的想法，漫漫吟唱，感觉有些漠不关心但其实却很在意……悲核中有许多朋克的元素，但这又不是仅仅只是朋克，独立音乐就是这样，编曲者想的到的，能用到的音乐元素的都会用上。\nEMO成分：主唱不会呐喊，不会尖叫，甚至放弃噪音。为何又说悲核中有EMO成分呢？因为，EMO不仅仅是音乐，更是一种艺术——缺少男子气概的伪中性艺术。（不是人 妖的意思喔！）在悲核里，“林黛玉”的忧郁、有气无力的成分十分明显。这与充满活力和男子汉气概的摇滚是相反的两个概念。悲核，真正的艺术！摇滚中的林黛玉，独立音乐的象征！\n独立音乐成分：在悲核中，有的时候似乎常人难以理解歌曲所要表达的意思。这与后摇滚（Post Rock）中的宏伟壮阔的主题和带有史诗色彩的中心思想可以形成一种对比：两者具相同的艺术表现力和底蕴，许多人似乎难以理解，但也有不同的两种表现方式——宏观与微观。后现代摇滚表现力是非常宏观的，而悲核的音乐很注重在一些很细节方面的事情，来体现宏观的事物。也许只有悲核作曲者和乐队自己能理解吧！所以说，悲核是一种独立的、具有自我意识的音乐流派。\n情歌成分：有的时候，悲核甚至没有人声。完全的纯音乐形式。悲核中有很多抒情小调。值得一提的是，有部分悲核的作品竟然是用欢快明亮的大调谱写而成的。这与幽暗悲伤的小调形成幽默性的明显特征。用大调写出悲伤的情歌，恐怕只有悲核乐才能做到……\n流行成分： 有的时候，悲核乐队会插入电音。电音的加入使悲核更加流行化，放弃了吉他的激烈失真，放弃了频繁的鼓点，放弃了咆哮的歌喉——其实悲核可以视为是非主流转主流音乐的一种音乐表现方式。\n\nSadcore is a subgenre occasionally identified by music journalists to describe examples of alternative rock characterised by bleak lyrics, downbeat melodies and slower tempos.

Throughout the '70s, soft rock dominated the airwaves and it eventually metamorphosed into the synthesized sounds of adult contemporary in the '80s.","songs":[{"id":"goy6q480bc","name":"Yesterday Once More","artist":"2DB757f6"},{"id":"b4M8Sd6f2f","name":"Shape of My Heart","artist":"SNxabb6b"},{"id":"b4FUuc5b8a","name":"She Will Be Loved","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"cgldB2bac8","name":"Hotel California","artist":"dOMl45894"},{"id":"cgRNWeb2fb","name":"Angel","artist":"2HK68fef"},{"id":"b4G2Od2c57","name":"Take Me To Your Heart","artist":"bwkRfd148"},{"id":"bf0qAQ830c97","name":"Say You Say Me","artist":"Te1c86a6"},{"id":"eYcGv356cd","name":"Casablanca","artist":"beFMbfa00"},{"id":"bACMxc3abc","name":"Never Say Never  ","artist":"6NM855c7"},{"id":"gowt0445e3","name":"Angel","artist":"bwi6ebdd6"},{"id":"N9kX73b9b","name":"The One You Love","artist":"48P7774c"},{"id":"NGY583df5","name":"Truly Madly Deeply","artist":"UAcb4ecc"}],"albums":[{"id":"eUjz4edfa","name":"Yesterday Once More: Greatest ...","artist":"2DB757f6"},{"id":"eUh28b6ba","name":"Songs About Jane","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"8rFh42ecf","name":"Ten Summoner's Tales","artist":"SNxabb6b"},{"id":"jgqB15939","name":"It Won't Be Soon Before Long","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"bdDJd1ef7","name":"Hell Freezes Over","artist":"dOMl45894"},{"id":"b1Cxq8K41005","name":"Red Pill Blues","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"d9Jg41715","name":"Hotel California","artist":"dOMl45894"},{"id":"fCMK7a491","name":"Truly The Love Songs","artist":"Te1c86a6"},{"id":"eUkh67be1","name":"Take Me to Your Heart","artist":"bwkRfd148"},{"id":"bC6Xa4E45561","name":"Singles","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"fIiZ51683","name":"All The Best Of MLTR","artist":"bwkRfd148"},{"id":"EuM78ad5","name":"Surfacing","artist":"2HK68fef"}],"artists":[{"id":"bwkd183b2","name":"Maroon 5"},{"id":"WfKc4a9a","name":"Lady Antebellum"},{"id":"2DB757f6","name":"Carpenters"},{"id":"bwi6ebdd6","name":"Jack Johnson"},{"id":"2EI7b787","name":"Celine Dion"},{"id":"bfMFwuI2da2c","name":"脸红的思春期"},{"id":"dOMl45894","name":"Eagles"},{"id":"SEIbc3e7","name":"Eric Clapton"},{"id":"T33dc99b","name":"Robbie Williams"},{"id":"4tn8f358","name":"Frank Sinatra"},{"id":"6NM855c7","name":"The Fray"},{"id":"SIC97f01","name":"Paul McCartney"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1200","name":"太空摇滚 Space Rock","description":"Space Rock这个词最早得追溯到70年代，那时是用来形容那些有着太空幻游味道的像Pink Floyd和Hawkwind这样的乐队。然而如今Space Rock是指新一代的另类/独立乐队，这些乐队从迷幻摇滚、环境（氛围）音乐中吸取音乐养分，而且经常还会受到实验和前卫音乐的影响。\n\nSpace Rock是那种几乎总是缓慢、催眠和非现实的；它尤其喜欢在传统歌曲结构上进行冗长、扰乱心绪的声响探险；它的人声有时就如同是闪烁器乐质地的附着。\n\n有些Space Rock乐队确实是以毒品来促发灵感，以此来给这种音乐带来令人麻醉的风格效果：沉重地混响的吉他声浪、极简的打击乐以及轻微的没精打采的人声。Space Rock的最显然的前辈当属Prog-Rock，但是在其后的发展中，它也从Krautrock、古典简约和The Jesus & Mary Chain风格的Noise Pop中吸取过灵感。\n\n最初的第一支Space Rock乐队是英国的极度低沉的极简主义团体Spacemen 3，它的臭名昭著的“Taking Drugs To Make Music To Take Drugs To”信条影响了随其后来的大多数乐队。在参与到英国的Shoegazer运动中的有些乐队是和Spaced Rock是有关系的，尤其是The Verve的早期作品，还有大多数的实验团体（如My Bloody Valentine）影响了Space Rock的复兴。\n\nSpace rock is a subgenre of rock music; the term originally referred to a group of early, mostly British, 1970s progressive and psychedelic rock bands such as Hawkwind and Pink Floyd, characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by electronic organs, synthesizers, experimental guitar work and science fiction or astronomical lyrical themes, though it was later repurposed to refer to a series of late 1980s British alternative rock bands that drew from earlier influences to create a more ambient but still melodic form of pop music. The term was revived in the 21st century to refer to a new crop of bands including The Flowers of Hell, Comets on Fire, and Flotation Toy Warning who diversely draw upon the ideas and sounds of both waves of the genre's founders.","songs":[{"id":"xNZFKzc77d1","name":"流浪地球","artist":"nmS3P378f47"},{"id":"P3I752902","name":"I Get My Beat","artist":"bxwte6790"},{"id":"xLqmlzadf57","name":"Kite","artist":"IEM4e39a"},{"id":"chxzmec12b","name":"Slide Away","artist":"SO298145"},{"id":"LFzt8a000","name":"Don't Stop the Rain","artist":"TACb1d59"},{"id":"JASieu23c7d","name":"One Velvet Day","artist":"iPIra92e7"},{"id":"mQBPSMd0ec3","name":"Viholliseni Maalla","artist":"cZE6381d1"},{"id":"PL1Pcda6c","name":"Wires","artist":"XWLd95b3"},{"id":"b0qPMc9419","name":"Down Through the Night","artist":"2Gk5ea62"},{"id":"b50yZb0dc1","name":"Tomorrow","artist":"7sj91753"},{"id":"b5KM2ba46f","name":"Centralia","artist":"Yasae541"},{"id":"Uuoy7253a","name":"The Third Casket","artist":"beHKb6375"}],"albums":[{"id":"bfMYyPL3209f","name":"流浪地球","artist":"nmS3P378f47"},{"id":"jkEZb6d36","name":"Alone with Everybody","artist":"bxwte6790"},{"id":"bfqo14ea6","name":"A   Storm in Heaven","artist":"SO298145"},{"id":"fKId72355","name":"Muzak","artist":"IEM4e39a"},{"id":"iR50160ce","name":"All That Noise","artist":"TACb1d59"},{"id":"CowR4786e","name":"Methodrone","artist":"cZE6381d1"},{"id":"cE8aTjc43d5","name":"Edge of Time","artist":"xyyeO99e869"},{"id":"bdVX9cb3c","name":"The Space Ritual Alive in Live...","artist":"2Gk5ea62"},{"id":"oJuP1b90e","name":"Aufheben","artist":"cZE6381d1"},{"id":"eD1o89243","name":"Heaven's End","artist":"31M658a6"},{"id":"9cDQfaf8c5b","name":"Back From Space","artist":"xgm4Oh98045"},{"id":"yhVAXRcb3ce","name":"Tiefenrausch","artist":"9dfn611833e"}],"artists":[{"id":"SO298145","name":"The Verve"},{"id":"2Mn77ca5","name":"Spiritualized"},{"id":"SMXbc9e0","name":"Spacemen 3"},{"id":"bwLdfd88b","name":"Acid Mothers Temple & the Melting Paraiso U.F.O."},{"id":"f6Yca6d9","name":"周韧"},{"id":"XUp9f0b8","name":"SIANspheric"},{"id":"bi129b9c3","name":"Moon Duo"},{"id":"bbbLc5852","name":"The December Sound"},{"id":"31K88afe","name":"Drop Nineteens"},{"id":"bsJnf04aa","name":"Love and Rockets"},{"id":"31M658a6","name":"Loop"},{"id":"dz9i406b0","name":"Flying Saucer Attack"}]},{"type":"style","id":"2070","name":"石人摇滚 Stoner Rock","description":"Stoner rock这种风格是存在的，这个名字是准确的，它算是重金属/硬摇滚的一个分支。一般音色和制作手法比较复古，接近70年代的声音。歌曲一般速度较慢，以riff为结构的根基，多数旋律都比较低沉，迷幻味道很重。\n\nStone，其实在欧美俗语中，就是说吸毒以后的那种迷幻感觉，所以Stoner Rock也就是为了表达那种意境而逐渐从前辈的迷幻摇滚发展起来的。也就是因为这种联系，这种音乐形式才得到这个毒品味道很重的名字。Stone这个词，不是\"石头\"的意思，而是动词，表示\"吸毒以后麻醉的感觉\"。所以多年以来\"Stoner Rock\" 这个词一直没有准确的中文译名。\n\nStoner Rock combines Blues Rock, the psychedelic elements from Psychedelic Rock, and the repetitive riffs of Doom Metal. Guitars are tuned low, the bass is heavy and tempo is mostly slow-to-mid. The vocals and production are usually raw.&nbsp;\n\nThe term stoner rock comes from the genre's connection with the use of marijuana, stoner being a slang term for a user of cannabis. It is sometimes believed that the bass heavy and psychedelic sound is meant to enhance the effects of drugs. The roots are in '60s and '70s bands like Black Sabbath and Blue Cheer, but what is called Stoner Rock today was pioneered by Californian bands such as Kyuss, Sleep and Fu Manchu.","songs":[{"id":"mQD5Dp71077","name":"Ephedra","artist":"bj7u21c9d"},{"id":"mSrdCZ6084f","name":"Acid Crusher","artist":"bM8v1f191"},{"id":"xNfRT8da1d2","name":"To Heaven and Back","artist":"mZnKac7ee4c"},{"id":"mS7xCo5d3fd","name":"Candy Mountain","artist":"9cysggf9d88"},{"id":"xLx6TT9b4e2","name":"Heartbeat","artist":"3Q5c5b136"},{"id":"xNz2bVa8df6","name":"Black Swan","artist":"x93ag9b07ec"},{"id":"bCmOJS448422","name":"Ayahuasca","artist":"9cyzrCe8a0d"},{"id":"xNrUmSab172","name":"Acid Crusher","artist":"bM8v1f191"},{"id":"8Iq3eEf3fbd","name":"Circle of Stoned Goats","artist":"nnAeoB1bfb2"},{"id":"xNouoIb4745","name":"The Black Code (Live)","artist":"bmy8b53d5"},{"id":"mTqhab51875","name":"Arthur","artist":"nnGbxL7ba7d"},{"id":"mSK5pk5981f","name":"The Hitchhiker","artist":"9dgb7Lea101"}],"albums":[{"id":"b1Cxd783d4fa","name":"More Nothing","artist":"mZnKac7ee4c"},{"id":"13C92df9d","name":"Soma","artist":"bj7u21c9d"},{"id":"bqHEGo3371a2","name":"EP #3","artist":"x93ag9b07ec"},{"id":"JXwBfd1fdc7","name":"Acid Crusher / Mount Swan","artist":"bM8v1f191"},{"id":"USfCGT27177","name":"Acid Crusher/Mount Swan","artist":"nn9krt8e58f"},{"id":"yhS9vxc14e3","name":"Primitive Blast","artist":"nnAdUE7ea2c"},{"id":"nnhEiS5cded","name":"Outlands","artist":"9cyzrCe8a0d"},{"id":"8Wxavue8c4f","name":"Seven","artist":"eH1s81d37"},{"id":"yhPvEdad889","name":"Carpe Diem","artist":"yhD3Dya770e"},{"id":"oN4Gf950f","name":"Theatre","artist":"3Q5c5b136"},{"id":"nnig5b622b4","name":"Vol. III & IV: Cult of the Voi...","artist":"nnAwFA8562f"},{"id":"yhQHS21139f","name":"Candy Mountain/Green","artist":"9cysggf9d88"}],"artists":[{"id":"W80b6980","name":"Boris"},{"id":"4or8ec3e","name":"Queens of the Stone Age"},{"id":"KJ2690b4","name":"True Widow"},{"id":"b8zeed397","name":"Causa Sui"},{"id":"bj7u21c9d","name":"My Sleeping Karma"},{"id":"iTsT13cf6","name":"汤汤水水"},{"id":"Ulndbe83","name":"Fu Manchu"},{"id":"Inj62366","name":"Truckfighters"},{"id":"c3M1PWca58e","name":"Radar Men From The Moon"},{"id":"xk646Zbf226","name":"35007"},{"id":"m7tms580843","name":"Vista Chino"},{"id":"biXDd1666","name":"Mustasch"}]},{"type":"style","id":"328","name":"冲浪摇滚 Surf Rock","description":"冲浪摇滚（Surf Rock）的诞生和1950年加利福尼亚的冲浪运动紧密相连，在1961-1966达到空前的欢迎的。以吉他手迪克•戴尔首创的带有回响的吉他声效为特色，潮湿而延绵不绝的音效使人自然而然地联想起加州海岸盛行的冲浪运动，因而得名。随后涌现的众多冲浪摇滚乐队中，一些是纯粹的“器乐冲浪者”，另一些则在乐队的编制中加入了主唱，The Beach Boys（沙滩男孩乐队）是后一种冲浪摇滚的典型代表，以完美的旋律及和声见长。早期冲浪摇滚的主题多半与阳光沙滩、摩托车和女孩相关，现在已经不局限主题性，更多的是延续了吉他回响音效的传承，当然都是轻快明朗的特质。不过直面事实冲浪摇滚已经落寞，可以说好久没有正统乐队出现了，更多的是新兴乐队在自身风格中呈现Surf Rock的特质。\n\nSurf Rock is a musical genre associated with surf culture which appeared in the late 1950s in California. This genre gained huge popularity from 1961, becoming one of the most popular genres in America in the first half of 1960s.&nbsp;\nIn its original form, surf rock is characterised by short instrumental songs, with cheerful melodies played on guitar on Rock & Roll rythms. Extensive use of reverb and tremolo is also part of the sound, as is the influence of Latin American Music music. The popularity of surf music was launched by the single \"Let's Go Trippin'\" by Dick Dale in 1961, and then confirmed by the hit \"Miserlou\" in 1962. Bands such as The Ventures and The Challengers followed in the same vein. From 1963, especially with the breakthrough of The Beach Boys, surf music became vocal, followed by The Trashmen and The Surfaris, for example. In 1966, the genre couldn't react to the invasion of british rock and the emergence of Psychedelic Rock, and begin to fall into disuse.&nbsp;\nBeginning from the late 1970s a number of Punk Rock musicians were inspired by the sonical ideas and concept of surf music, resulting in Surf Punk, a musical genre associated with underground acts such as The Barracudas, Man or Astro-Man? and Surf Punks. Skate Punk is also often associated with surf music, mainly because of its place of birth, California, and because of its close relation to boardsports culture. Surf rock has also be perceived as an important influence in the sound of similarly-minded and more popular bands of the 1980s and 1990s like Pixies and Dead Kennedys. Bands like the aforementioned Man or Astro-Man?, The Mermen, Los Straitjackets and Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet have also been credited with a sparse revival of the original surf rock sound. The heavy use of surf music hits in the soundtrack to the cult film Pulp Fiction in 1994 led to a moderate yet continuing popular interest in the genre since then.","songs":[{"id":"xLoQuo999e3","name":"California Dreaming","artist":"2CD6462a"},{"id":"xLqPnTae767","name":"Down By The Water","artist":"bh9nbf48d"},{"id":"mQLLFx665b4","name":"人间惆怅客","artist":"bMiZ24db0"},{"id":"xL6X18d0557","name":"Dull Boy","artist":"eIXm7e6d6"},{"id":"cRdqx24961","name":"Take What's Mine","artist":"WNcd7193"},{"id":"xLxou7d8d7d","name":"If Only We Remain","artist":"iPrM16735"},{"id":"8GhDbUfe71e","name":"Polly","artist":"bmOCceefd"},{"id":"MySJ6a59e","name":"Bullwinkle, Pt. 2","artist":"U6o10fac"},{"id":"xN4Oza9c725","name":"Empathy, Now!","artist":"yiuZY196c86"},{"id":"mSMfAW65d38","name":"Never Wanna Leave","artist":"nnAotq6f4b3"},{"id":"mQ9P5z70be1","name":"This Dead Town","artist":"dLxq3fb34"},{"id":"bqxoWzY59964","name":"dream, ivory","artist":"nn9Mxe503c7"}],"albums":[{"id":"fDFn83f5f","name":"The Platinum Collection (Sound...","artist":"2CD6462a"},{"id":"fNWs578a2","name":"The Drums","artist":"bh9nbf48d"},{"id":"ceW3kM68221","name":"超时空歌女的快活","artist":"bMiZ24db0"},{"id":"cXmRZtb23b8","name":"Chinese Fountain","artist":"eIXm7e6d6"},{"id":"oJ0sf442b","name":"That's Why God Made the Radio","artist":"2CD6462a"},{"id":"o4cIf8616","name":"Portamento","artist":"bh9nbf48d"},{"id":"nnnrhe64f1e","name":"Songs of Innocence & Experienc...","artist":"yhD2wCb3ae5"},{"id":"kIey9a0ec","name":"Greatest Hits: 50 Big Ones","artist":"2CD6462a"},{"id":"nuUae9f37","name":"The Shore","artist":"WNcd7193"},{"id":"jSV7cf59f","name":"Summertime!","artist":"bh9nbf48d"},{"id":"DfX69c6b","name":"Surfer Girl","artist":"2CD6462a"},{"id":"gx3H55539","name":"Two Wounded Birds","artist":"iPrM16735"}],"artists":[{"id":"2Jg75adb","name":"Pixies"},{"id":"2CD6462a","name":"The Beach Boys"},{"id":"bh9nbf48d","name":"The Drums"},{"id":"b1CSkdE3f20e","name":"Summer Salt"},{"id":"cRvcRTc6ee3","name":"never young  beach"},{"id":"yiuqxna86a3","name":"No Play"},{"id":"yhRtP5ba900","name":"South Penguin"},{"id":"eIXm7e6d6","name":"The Growlers"},{"id":"SO1c2227","name":"The Ventures"},{"id":"dEgj41782","name":"Surfer Blood"},{"id":"bsGje90c9","name":"Dick Dale"},{"id":"dLxq3fb34","name":"French Films"}]},{"type":"style","id":"333","name":"沼泽摇滚 Swamp Pop","description":"Swamp pop is a musical genre indigenous to the Acadiana region of south Louisiana and an adjoining section of southeast Texas.

It's simple, acoustic-based music that spins everyday events and common people into mythic status. Many traditional folksongs have no known author, they have simply evolved over the years. Most of the earliest recorded folk music was of this nature, but with Woody Guthrie, topical folk began making its way to record. Still, many artists, including the Weavers and Pete Seeger, chose to mix traditional songs with newer material, either written by the artists themselves or other contemporary musicians.

Thomas）提出[来源请求]。\n民间音乐有系统之定义研究虽起自19世纪，但实际形成却可溯自远古，例如中国春秋战国以前之诗经歌曲或今仍盛行之中国民歌等，亦可视为民间音乐。而不论古今或地区，民间音乐乐型态之传统要素与特性有下列几项：\n\n1.民间音乐具有把现在与过去连结之连续性\n2.个体与群体产生出不同类型的创作，并有其一定差异性\n3.决定音乐形式或音乐存在，纯粹由社会力选择\n\n民间流行的、富于民族色彩的歌曲，称为民谣或民歌。民谣的历史悠远，故其作者多不知名。民谣的内容丰富，有宗教的、爱情的、战争的、工作的，也有饮酒、舞蹈作乐、祭典等等。民谣既是表现一个民族的感情与习尚，因此各有其独特的音阶与情调风格。如法国民谣的蓬勃、意大利民谣的热情、英国民谣的淳朴、日本民谣的悲愤、西班牙民谣的狂放不羁、中国民谣的缠绵悱恻，都表现了强烈的民族气质与色彩。\n\n民间流传的歌谣。有的内容与时事政治有关。近代作曲家，有用民谣为主题来创作各种乐曲的，如德沃夏克(antonin dvorák)的《自新大陆》交响曲、柴可夫斯基(peter llyitch tchaikovsky)的《第四交响曲》；丹第(vincentd'indy)的《山歌交响曲》；哈利斯(roy harris)的《民歌交响曲》；布鲁赫(mar bruch)的《苏格兰民歌协奏曲》；威廉士沃恩(williams vaughan)的《英吉利民歌组曲》；杜宾斯基(arcadydubensky)的《史蒂芬佛斯特组曲》；以及李亚道夫(anatol constantinovitch liadov)的《八段民歌管弦乐曲》等，皆为美妙动人的音乐，受到世人普遍的欢迎。\n\nFolk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music.\n\nTraditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted by mouth, as music of the lower classes, and as music with unknown composers. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. One meaning often given is that of old songs, with no known composers; another is music that has been transmitted and evolved by a process of oral transmission or performed by custom over a long period of time.\n\nStarting in the mid-20th century a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This process and period is called the (second) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. This form of music is sometimes called contemporary folk music or folk revival music to distinguish it from earlier folk forms. Smaller similar revivals have occurred elsewhere in the world at other times, but the term folk music has typically not been applied to the new music created during those revivals. This type of folk music also includes fusion genres such as folk rock, folk metal, electric folk, and others. While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, in English it shares the same name, and it often shares the same performers and venues as traditional folk music. Even individual songs may be a blend of the two.","songs":[{"id":"xLGeYqb684b","name":"借我","artist":"8CAhXd1bb77"},{"id":"xLvvCZ9bea8","name":"Walk Away","artist":"bEb718e40"},{"id":"8GrQo9fa518","name":"女儿情","artist":"K6cd449"},{"id":"xL2CuZa9a7b","name":"唱歌的孩子","artist":"djokgab9355"},{"id":"xMPOzia704b","name":"我要你","artist":"b0726633"},{"id":"8FZpDafbabc","name":"Levi Blues","artist":"EG6580ec"},{"id":"mQ8n6X5e8bf","name":"Free To Be Me","artist":"b5Ahe2e5d"},{"id":"bCkE7GE480f0","name":"Safe And Sound","artist":"MmF7fb3a"},{"id":"mSwpgN51147","name":"远走高飞（Cover 金志文）","artist":"m10d15889af"},{"id":"mQ5OeO760ac","name":"在冬天和奶奶一起晒太阳","artist":"b9Ade4ce0"},{"id":"mQH7kd8f118","name":"奔跑在光阴里的少年","artist":"bnm09ffdd"}],"albums":[{"id":"yhE9Cycd5e3","name":"算云烟","artist":"8CAhXd1bb77"},{"id":"gmDF5ad12","name":"Red","artist":"bEb718e40"},{"id":"jL6ea4f0","name":"还是会寂寞","artist":"f9yaaafc"},{"id":"Y2Lc427d","name":"Groupies","artist":"f9yaaafc"},{"id":"mgnwguaac00","name":"你是猴子请来的救兵吗？","artist":"djokgab9355"},{"id":"nnc3Js92cbc","name":"我要你","artist":"b0726633"},{"id":"xGZooebdfb4","name":"女儿情","artist":"K6cd449"},{"id":"b1fr1cF417be","name":"私奔丽江","artist":"xLlcwDc9617"},{"id":"9czLT8eaf4c","name":"之外","artist":"mXQ7It7f5c4"},{"id":"gjqH8cb7a","name":"The Things We Do For Love","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"hkkc4bcd","name":"滚石香港黄金十年 陈绮贞精选","artist":"f9yaaafc"},{"id":"bqHB4Jm554ae","name":"青鸟与诗","artist":"yiueY5c85e3"}],"artists":[{"id":"bjSSdf7ae","name":"赵雷"},{"id":"IOd0c43","name":"朴树"},{"id":"198ed78","name":"罗大佑"},{"id":"eEHg831cc","name":"花粥"},{"id":"WeEc82f3","name":"郝云"},{"id":"b0726633","name":"老狼"},{"id":"hepcf9d2","name":"小娟&山谷里的居民"},{"id":"oRq2a8e2","name":"中島みゆき"},{"id":"cMzJ338ad","name":"梁晓雪"},{"id":"e3T5b0ec","name":"低苦艾"},{"id":"bV6o25571","name":"丢火车乐队"},{"id":"Uizcadc1","name":"Joan Baez"}]},{"type":"style","id":"828","name":"当代民谣 Contemporary Folk","description":"当代民谣Contemporary Folk作为民谣下一大分支，根源于传统民谣但同时受到流行音乐的影响，在越来越多的创作中融入了流行/摇滚乐的制作形式和除主力吉他外的器乐。在后期几十年中，当代民谣歌手也时有跨界进入流行音乐的领域，但他们在内容创作，歌词格式，现场表演地点的特殊偏好等依然保持着源自传统民谣的印记，同时歌手对生活和社会现实的认识，依然保持一种非常私人化的创作和歌唱表达方式。\n\n当代民谣又被指的是Bob Dylan之后的70年代及以后的“民谣”创作人群体。在Dylan之前，多数“民谣”乐手演绎传统的“民谣”歌曲或者创作广泛的关注时下的歌曲，Dylan之后，“民谣”歌手改变了原先的方法，他们的音乐不仅拓宽了边界、也接受了某些“流行／摇滚”（Pop/Rock）音乐的制作技巧和配器，而且他们的歌曲日益内省，所关注的内容则由个体取代了社会，当然按时间段来区分也是值得商榷的。\n\n\nContemporary Folk refers to post-Bob Dylan folk singer/songwriters of the 70s and beyond. Prior to Dylan, most folk performers interpreted classic folk songs or wrote broad-based, topical songs. After Dylan, folk singers changed their approach. Not only did their music open up, accepting certain pop/rock production techniques and instrumentation, but their songs became increasingly introspective, concentrating on the personal instead of the social. In the decades to follow, contemporary folk singers sometimes crossed over into the pop mainstream, but their sound stayed rooted in folk traditions and they tended to frequent their own circles, releasing albums on independent labels and playing folk clubs and coffee houses.","songs":[{"id":"8G4eN5eeff3","name":"小半","artist":"f98Xpl26805"},{"id":"mQ9Jmv53091","name":"南方姑娘","artist":"bjSSdf7ae"},{"id":"xL1DGzae7da","name":"安和桥","artist":"bC5Ie8afb"},{"id":"mQOY9382009","name":"理想三旬","artist":"bfqyHxU30726"},{"id":"OK6b60562","name":"Say Hello","artist":"Wfrdad86"},{"id":"d3lgE27a29","name":"The Sound of Silence","artist":"SM3974d9"},{"id":"cM7bL205c2","name":"Flightless Bird, American Mouth","artist":"T1A9a19b"},{"id":"OIGh56dcf","name":"Craigie Hill","artist":"6i5b565e"},{"id":"d2dnQ2a8bf","name":"In My Secret Life","artist":"bVAEr19160d"},{"id":"b125Fa8fe8","name":"9 Crimes","artist":"btJO1bbc0"},{"id":"esQzo50232","name":"世界","artist":"FzU7e1f7"}],"albums":[{"id":"ksqr9b5bc","name":"安和桥北","artist":"bC5Ie8afb"},{"id":"bC6XMih71a9f","name":"小梦大半","artist":"f98Xpl26805"},{"id":"96iz3df24","name":"赵小雷","artist":"bjSSdf7ae"},{"id":"b0Z1lSb3ce10","name":"浓烟下的诗歌电台","artist":"bfqyHxU30726"},{"id":"eUrN50be3","name":"These Friends of Mine","artist":"bwmX19f55"},{"id":"dUVSdreaf86","name":"长安夜","artist":"Wr7969fb"},{"id":"nnc2si955fa","name":"一如年少模样","artist":"bfqyHxU30726"},{"id":"r49A1ea78","name":"Cara Dillon","artist":"6i5b565e"},{"id":"DwM8325f","name":"Ten New Songs","artist":"SERde896"},{"id":"c6jrP0b4931","name":"我的名字叫做安","artist":"m8577O62c07"},{"id":"b4Umee81d","name":"Sounds of Silence","artist":"SM3974d9"},{"id":"USgqrc28b52","name":"谈论孤独","artist":"9cyw3E1877d"}],"artists":[{"id":"f98Xpl26805","name":"陈粒"},{"id":"bC5Ie8afb","name":"宋冬野"},{"id":"SERde896","name":"Leonard Cohen"},{"id":"SFQbc0bd","name":"Bob Dylan"},{"id":"btJO1bbc0","name":"Damien Rice"},{"id":"s7Q3be4f","name":"左小祖咒"},{"id":"mzYLRe7bb0a","name":"左安西西"},{"id":"6hF751e3","name":"Yann Tiersen"},{"id":"6i5b565e","name":"Cara Dillon"},{"id":"btCpee49b","name":"The Innocence Mission"},{"id":"bzXZe6410","name":"Angus & Julia Stone"},{"id":"SM3974d9","name":"Simon & Garfunkel"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1389","name":"独立民谣 Indie Folk","description":"Indie folk在1990年前后开始萌芽，独立摇滚圈的唱作人受到1950、1960、1960民谣和乡村音乐的影响，结合当代民谣的吉他原声和独立摇滚朗朗上口的旋律曲调创作出的新的歌曲形式。（早期的艺人有Lou Barlow, Jeff Buckley,Elliott Smith。）同时Indie folk和 freak folk, Psych folk, Baroque pop有着千丝万缕的联系，，在2000年一批优秀的艺人和乐队涌现了出来，包括 Bright Eyes, Beirut, Bon Iver, The Avett Brothers, Arthur & Yu, Fleet Foxes,The Decemberists,Iron & Wine, Okkervil River, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Noah and the Whale等，Indie folk由此也达到了一个新的受众高度。\n\nIndie folk is a music genre that arose in the 1990s from singer/songwriters in the indie rock community influenced by the folk music scenes of the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, country music and indie rock.\nA few early artists included Lou Barlow, Jeff Buckley and Elliott Smith.

Folk-pop doesn't have ringing guitars and rougher edges of folk-rock; instead, it is softer, gentler, and more pop-oriented.","songs":[{"id":"xMPX2ec031e","name":"成都","artist":"bjSSdf7ae"},{"id":"JRo6efd2","name":"思念是一种病","artist":"s8F3b02c"},{"id":"8G4eN5eeff3","name":"小半","artist":"f98Xpl26805"},{"id":"8GsFwX1a7f8","name":"南山南","artist":"bDHDf17a3"},{"id":"mQOY9382009","name":"理想三旬","artist":"bfqyHxU30726"},{"id":"b4FYFabf31","name":"New Soul","artist":"Wjqb1242"},{"id":"mSOSyU7fa63","name":"陷阱","artist":"yiv2Qvb37d4"},{"id":"b4Eet9fdd1","name":"Valder Fields","artist":"d2mY401ce"},{"id":"OK6b60562","name":"Say Hello","artist":"Wfrdad86"},{"id":"OEaL70399","name":"Gotta Have You","artist":"WfQ16428"},{"id":"xLwlGya3687","name":"Let Her Go","artist":"XeBa04d3"},{"id":"b4Waj9edf8","name":"You Belong to Me","artist":"WzIc1288"}],"albums":[{"id":"nnc4G574262","name":"无法长大","artist":"bjSSdf7ae"},{"id":"ybOxkJc33f1","name":"吉姆餐厅","artist":"bjSSdf7ae"},{"id":"bC6XMih71a9f","name":"小梦大半","artist":"f98Xpl26805"},{"id":"96iz3df24","name":"赵小雷","artist":"bjSSdf7ae"},{"id":"JfNDsi1ef23","name":"孤岛","artist":"bDHDf17a3"},{"id":"b0Z1lSb3ce10","name":"浓烟下的诗歌电台","artist":"bfqyHxU30726"},{"id":"g515nG29c93","name":"南北","artist":"cf8F1e684"},{"id":"jgqNd7632","name":"Yael Naim","artist":"Wjqb1242"},{"id":"yhTquPad219","name":"陷阱","artist":"yiv2Qvb37d4"},{"id":"xSgdokcc93f","name":"我是海雅谷慕","artist":"ihyffebb"},{"id":"8ra469741","name":"In Between Dreams","artist":"bwi6ebdd6"},{"id":"eUrN50be3","name":"These Friends of Mine","artist":"bwmX19f55"}],"artists":[{"id":"f32b5ea7","name":"许巍"},{"id":"f98Xpl26805","name":"陈粒"},{"id":"beHz11b9f","name":"Olivia Ong"},{"id":"cf8F1e684","name":"好妹妹"},{"id":"Wozbe967","name":"Priscilla Ahn"},{"id":"eiqn71154","name":"Ed Sheeran"},{"id":"Wfabeb9e","name":"Keren Ann"},{"id":"bwi6ebdd6","name":"Jack Johnson"},{"id":"d2mY401ce","name":"Tamas Wells"},{"id":"bwj817a68","name":"Sophie Zelmani"},{"id":"WfQ16428","name":"The Weepies"},{"id":"b9Ade4ce0","name":"赵照"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3026","name":"校园民谣 Campus Folk","description":"校园民谣就是广受学生喜爱，流行于校园，体现校园生活和学子心境或感受的创作，其或称为“校园歌谣”、“现代民歌”、“乐府民风”等等。校园民谣朝气蓬勃，极富有校园味道，毫无矫饰，完全是率真性情的流露，听起来十分感人，它形象地反映出青年学子的生活，表现出年轻人的蓬勃朝气、青春活力以及他们那富有诗意的浪漫气息，其曲风总体来说朴实明快、积极向上，充满活力，深受人们的喜爱和传唱。\n\n校园民谣概念的首次出现，是在七十年代初的台湾。扬弦的《渡口》、赵树海的《子夜徘徊》、胡德夫的《少年中国》及\"木吉他\"全辑等。这些人的作品包括台湾民谣时代后期的大批校园歌手，如罗大佑、齐豫、侯德建、黄大成、红蚂蚁等，他们的涌现，构成了一个绝对经典的时代。\n\n校园民谣在传入大陆后，逐渐成了一种音乐现象：它首先被那些对音乐有着执着追求的校园歌手们所吟唱、使之流行于中国大陆的各个高等学校，然后因为一个成功的商业运作迅速风靡了整个社会并产生了极大反响。校园民谣，它记录了一个时代、一种学校的文化氛围、一代莘莘学子的梦想与追求和对易逝的青春岁月的怀念。","songs":[{"id":"jYPyac5fc","name":"风吹麦浪","artist":"EIca21f"},{"id":"JAWhMu223dc","name":"送别","artist":"IOd0c43"},{"id":"OFCO4bfa9","name":"一生有你","artist":"fZEd1da4"},{"id":"olK1e6a69","name":"想把我唱给你听","artist":"b0726633"},{"id":"DDz95ae9","name":"丁香花","artist":"Kncfeff"},{"id":"ka8Fddd92","name":"那些花儿","artist":"IOd0c43"},{"id":"xLBw83d6c96","name":"逝年","artist":"cu5f4m12c08"},{"id":"iTr0be17f","name":"嘀答(吉它版)","artist":"fEEd07d7"},{"id":"xL3qkh9af33","name":"北京爱情","artist":"f2Od3b71"},{"id":"jZo2bfc27","name":"一生有你","artist":"fZEd1da4"},{"id":"OGPNc62f3","name":"给郁结的诗","artist":"E3a7411e"},{"id":"b1qiBc73da2b","name":"就像是一块没有记忆的石头","artist":"mXQ7It7f5c4"}],"albums":[{"id":"dmn72034","name":"想念你","artist":"EIca21f"},{"id":"DbRZ77356","name":"寂寞星空·见歌","artist":"EIca21f"},{"id":"fN8d77f3","name":"似水流年","artist":"EIca21f"},{"id":"jgdYb516e","name":"那时花开 电影原声带","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"gk396ca2","name":"我去2000年","artist":"IOd0c43"},{"id":"mzg3Zs8ef9b","name":"送别","artist":"IOd0c43"},{"id":"fVnf93ab7","name":"慢慢懂","artist":"JDn7c634"},{"id":"ttS6032c","name":"丁香花","artist":"Kncfeff"},{"id":"9czLT8eaf4c","name":"之外","artist":"mXQ7It7f5c4"},{"id":"djt915ce","name":"北京的冬天","artist":"b0726633"},{"id":"Y2Xf6b98","name":"我心飞翔 电影原声音乐","artist":"bCS31b42"},{"id":"sgX30939","name":"老家","artist":"fEEd07d7"}],"artists":[{"id":"IOd0c43","name":"朴树"},{"id":"fZEd1da4","name":"水木年华"},{"id":"b0726633","name":"老狼"},{"id":"9cCsDwf9b01","name":"房东的猫"},{"id":"bCS31b42","name":"高晓松"},{"id":"nngwB8e175a","name":"1022女声"},{"id":"f2Od3b71","name":"小柯"},{"id":"fOSe02c7","name":"叶蓓"},{"id":"3n731c0","name":"沈庆"},{"id":"fEAbbf7a","name":"筠子"},{"id":"bfMFsd831a0f","name":"徐秉龙"},{"id":"E3a7411e","name":"小安"}]},{"type":"style","id":"809","name":"传统民谣 Traditional Folk","description":"传统民谣融合十九世纪初期美国东部乡村地区的爱尔兰及苏格兰移民的民谣、德州弦乐曲及江湖走唱卖药歌而成，曲调轻松诙谐，好听悦耳，和缓温暖，大多以叙事及抒发感情为主，主要乐器是民谣吉他及斑鸠琴琴有时会佐以曼陀林、手风琴、小提琴、口琴极简单手鼓调味，洋溢着浓浓乡村香草味及校园民歌自弹自唱风情。\n\n\nTraditional Folk refers to the folk songs of the first half of the 20th century, before folk became the province of personal singer/songwriters like Bob Dylan.

It is defined by an elegant and ornate style of arrangement and production, creating a sound that can be alternately described as wistful, fey, pastoral and whimsical, often featuring celestial, crystalline female vocals and a variety of instruments as accompaniment. These include, either separately or as part of an ensemble, piano, drums, harpsichord and various horns, woodwinds and stringed instruments (both orchestral and plucked). \n\nWhile much of the style uses the traditional small ensemble sizes of Chamber Music within a non-classical acoustic style, Chamber Folk can also feature lush orchestral flourishes and similar aspects of arrangement found in other musical styles such as Baroque Pop, for example, Nico's Chelsea Girl and Joanna Newsom's Ys.","songs":[{"id":"xLrMuRb0d37","name":"Riverside","artist":"bA9Xeca75"},{"id":"9nVa429ba","name":"Comptine d'un autre été : L'Après

DiFranco。说到它的起源，不得不说一说1983年的那点儿破事。一个叫Lach的小青年带着自己的梦想来到了传说中的Folk City，渴望能够寻找到演出的机会。然而，老板在听了他的演出后，却说，你的音乐太朋克了。第二年，Lach自己在纽约东城区开了家名为the Fort的俱乐部。由于开业恰好撞上了纽约民谣艺术节，这个天生反骨的家伙就把the Fort的开业称为纽约反民谣艺术节。一年后，警方关闭了the Fort，于是the Fort就变成了一个流动性很强的反民谣演出场所。在1993年，反民谣已经得到了国际上的认可，并成为了多个艺人的垫脚石。Beck, Regina Spektor, 以及the Moldy Peaches，都是反民谣的代表人物。《纽约时报》曾在一篇报道中写道，他们（即以上提到的艺人）都有个共同的特征，那就是用颠覆传统且毫无惧怕的态度去创作。\n到了2000年左右，反民谣的概念传入英国，并迅速在伦敦，曼彻斯特以及布莱顿的地下音乐圈中传播开来。直到2006年八月，在当月的Timeout杂志中，反民谣已经被认为是伦敦最热门的亚文化之一了。\n从音乐来源看，反民谣主要来自于民谣与朋克。它继承了民谣的和缓和木吉他的伴奏，同时也吸收了朋克的激进，节奏以及大胆。它不再只拘泥于民谣对人生对世界亦或是对政治的忧郁和哀叹，它更多的是像朋克一般集中于自我以及自我与世界的关系。反之，它抛弃了朋克的简陋，无畏和大汗淋漓，而是采取了民谣的平静，冷眼旁观整个世界。而在歌词创作方面，反民谣大约可以分为两类。一类向流行靠近，另一类则向独立靠近。前者我们看到的是Regina Spektor，后者我们看到的是Kimya Dawson。歌词大多以简单的东西来表现歌曲的基调。在留给听者更多想象空间的同时，又不至于像听Bright Eyes似的消耗自己的脑细胞。而且，最要命的是，常常在这些简单哼唱的歌词中，我们听到的是更多更纯粹干净的温暖。\nLach在接受《纽约时报》的采访时曾说，刚开始的时候，我们是用民谣化朋克的方式来摇滚（When we started, we were to folk what punk was to rock.）。而当读到这句话的时候，我想到去年听Sonic Youth的新砖The Eternal时，曾读到过这样几句话，“民谣和朋克都对现状极度不满，两者以不同的方式逃避：民谣怀旧，通过退行到童年稚嫩、无辜、干净的状态，来维持起码的生存愿望；朋克破坏，通过否认仇视并破坏一切，在毁灭之后涅槃。”\n可以说，民谣和朋克是音乐史上最激进的两种音乐。前者把一切都闷在心里，后者却毫无保留地表现出来。音乐史上从朋克转型到民谣，从民谣转型到朋克的音乐人都大有人在，诸如，Feist， Tony Dekker等。而反民谣，作为民谣与朋克的混合产物，让我们看到了其中和作用的奇妙反应物。或许少了民谣的内敛与深刻，少了朋克的张扬与无惧，但是反民谣的存在，却的确为这个世界上所不可缺少的。\n\n\n Each country has their own folk music, but the genre usually refers to American and British music that has been passed through the generations by oral tradition. It's simple, acoustic-based music that spins everyday events and common people into mythic status. Many traditional folksongs have no known author, they have simply evolved over the years. Most of the earliest recorded folk music was of this nature, but with Woody Guthrie, topical folk began making its way to record. Still, many artists, including the Weavers and Pete Seeger, chose to mix traditional songs with newer material, either written by the artists themselves or other contemporary musicians. Initially, Bob Dylan functioned in that style, but by his second album, =The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,= he began relying entirely on original material, thereby ushering the modern era of folk, where most performers sang their own (usually personally and introspective) material, and only occasionally throwing in covers.","songs":[{"id":"f9p3q4148c","name":"Fidelity","artist":"bN3a24a09"},{"id":"xNhpIFdfc73","name":"我还年轻

Unlike original \"apocalyptic folk\", it doesn't incorporate any post-industrial or post-punk influences. Instead, Ambient and Nordic Folk Music elements can often be heard. Also, experimental and apocalyptic nature of pioneering neofolk bands is rejected in favour of more melancholic and minimalist soundscapes. Vocals can be hushed, whispered, ethereal, depressing and traditional folk influenced, although instrumental tracks are very common too. As far as lyrics are concerned, dark folk artists usually focus on \"dark\" themes such as desolation, depression or death as well as paganism, nature, history, etc. and they are often sang in languages native to performers. Due to lyrical and stylistic overlap, dark folk is closely related to Metal (most notably Black Metal) music with many artists combining these two genres. \n\nUlver's Kveldssanger is widely considered as one of its earliest and most important releases, but dark folk has roots in the original neofolk movement as well, most notably Fire + Ice whose impact on the German scene was huge.

The 1997 CD reissue of Harry Smith's 1952 landmark archive Anthology of American Folk Music seemed to kindle a spark in music fans much in the same way that the original LPs did in the early 50s (which eventually helped bring about the folk revival). Artists like Gillian Welch and Iris Dement who had been recording earthy folk music faithful to the Carter Family and Woody Guthrie found themselves attracting attention from an audience who would not consider themselves fans of country or folk music. The soundtrack to the 2000 film O Brother Where Art Thou found surprising success on the Billboard charts and ended up helping to revive the earnest feel of the acoustic folk music from the first half of the 20th century. Rooted in music from the Appalachian mountains and long honored dust bowl ballads, musicians like John Hartford, Norman Blake and Jay Ungar & Molly Mason recorded new songs based around traditional folk structures and themes, while artists such as the Handsome Family, Freakwater and Nickel Creek came at the music from a more progressive \"alternative\" slant, still evoking the honest, spiritual nature of this time-honored style.","songs":[{"id":"b254dc1351","name":"Goodnight Moon","artist":"bvn7f59bf"},{"id":"emIcI33530","name":"Forever at Your Feet","artist":"WuXcb4e9"},{"id":"b3ZBcabce8","name":"Far from Any Road","artist":"Vl49803f"},{"id":"xLsML3b77c9","name":"All the Stars","artist":"cMxu314a4"},{"id":"8Gt88gf1fe0","name":"秋一把 Qiu Yi Ba","artist":"3PvC39fef"},{"id":"Na788af69","name":"Marry Me","artist":"Tjydbfdb"},{"id":"b25xye084f","name":"Sunny Side of the Mountain","artist":"5lK78c3b"},{"id":"xLulwoaba1d","name":"Milk Carton Kid","artist":"bEv1e3d09"},{"id":"ci64Nf728a","name":"Watch the Stars","artist":"buku2c5d2"},{"id":"f7FJG4288d","name":"Wayside/Back in Time","artist":"cBp3306a9"},{"id":"UI28528b9","name":"Charlie Darwin","artist":"dBm461cc8"},{"id":"LxGn67fad","name":"Let the Mystery Be","artist":"btis16de6"}],"albums":[{"id":"nm1oe6706","name":"I Oughtta Give You a Shot in t...","artist":"bvn7f59bf"},{"id":"4fWE3c087","name":"Sleepy Little Sailor","artist":"WuXcb4e9"},{"id":"jaspc9939","name":"Tainted Love: Mating Calls And...","artist":"bvn7f59bf"},{"id":"jaHhce9bb","name":"Singing Bones","artist":"Vl49803f"},{"id":"zMSw32cd6","name":"Who's Got Trouble?","artist":"bvn7f59bf"},{"id":"eOjl75ea6","name":"Rough Dreams","artist":"bvn7f59bf"},{"id":"kkIccc2d6","name":"Bright Morning Stars","artist":"cMxu314a4"},{"id":"kswy979e6","name":"Prologue","artist":"bEv1e3d09"},{"id":"eLZA6ca81","name":"The Black Swan","artist":"buku2c5d2"},{"id":"4IhZ34dc1","name":"Beasts of Seasons","artist":"dBvn3d859"},{"id":"nmN2e79c8","name":"Soul Journey","artist":"cBp3306a9"},{"id":"jKwI130a1","name":"Your Heart Is a Glorious Machi...","artist":"bf18e0928"}],"artists":[{"id":"bvn7f59bf","name":"Shivaree"},{"id":"WuXcb4e9","name":"Oh Susanna"},{"id":"Vl49803f","name":"The Handsome Family"},{"id":"2RJ51239","name":"Bill Frisell"},{"id":"bl7Aa3ee4","name":"稷廬"},{"id":"bwuWfd9f4","name":"Sagittarius"},{"id":"bwkKf20c6","name":"Meg Baird"},{"id":"cBp3306a9","name":"Gillian Welch"},{"id":"5lK78c3b","name":"Dan Tyminski"},{"id":"be1Hb1654","name":"Seasick Steve"},{"id":"dBvn3d859","name":"Laura Gibson"},{"id":"bemU1868f","name":"Abigail Washburn"}]},{"type":"style","id":"633","name":"瑞典民谣 Swedish Folk","description":"瑞典民谣早期有部分只有乐器演奏，到后来的本国语言的人声演唱相结合，多以欢快为主，让人舞蹈的。\nSwedish folk music is a genre of music based largely on folkloric collection work that began in the early 19th century in Sweden.

Its beginnings came in the post-disco environment of Chicago/New York and Detroit, the cities who spawned house and techno (respectively) during the 1980s. Later that decade, club-goers in Britain latched onto the fusion of mechanical and sensual, and returned the favor to hungry Americans with new styles like jungle/drum'n'bass and trip-hop. Though most all early electronica was danceable, by the beginning of the '90s, producers were also making music for the headphones and chill-out areas as well, resulting in dozens of stylistic fusions like ambient-house, experimental techno, tech-house, electro-techno, etc. Typical for the many styles gathered under the umbrella was a focus on danceable grooves, very loose song structure (if any), and, in many producers, a relentless desire to find a new sound no matter how tepid the results.","songs":[{"id":"b1qqCyz3c4ec","name":"Faded","artist":"xb8rB8a13c9"},{"id":"bqvbMEw38ea4","name":"Intro","artist":"ecUI723af"},{"id":"mQQsBn8e419","name":"Time","artist":"wXtvjVaaae2"},{"id":"xLs1ohd1254","name":"Super Mario Bros. - Small Mario Jump","artist":"GKX68abb"},{"id":"mQXZxz7a707","name":"Let Me Love You","artist":"bgZGd035c"},{"id":"mSJxp511cc1","name":"Friendships (Original Mix)","artist":"nn9Ywk6ec63"},{"id":"mQ34Sr5b241","name":"The Saltwater Room","artist":"8Oz5571c"},{"id":"xN9aMfc0dde","name":"Way Back Home","artist":"iRpCbdcc2"},{"id":"mQFneH894ab","name":"Royals","artist":"jbuDqp64e9d"},{"id":"mSqZde623aa","name":"Something Just Like This","artist":"iUylaf308"},{"id":"PKBZ4e5b0","name":"La La La","artist":"7Ua5459f"},{"id":"xLIDNuca197","name":"HandClap","artist":"blSob27e5"}],"albums":[{"id":"US3fHx25c3a","name":"二十四节气","artist":"USBfFU2c402"},{"id":"9aRl4109a","name":"xx","artist":"ecUI723af"},{"id":"cu2UpXc9012","name":"Time","artist":"wXtvjVaaae2"},{"id":"fBPb791c1","name":"Ocean Eyes","artist":"8Oz5571c"},{"id":"mfBpCv78635","name":"Pure Heroine","artist":"jbuDqp64e9d"},{"id":"yhOOZ6bbb12","name":"Something Just Like This","artist":"iUylaf308"},{"id":"nnikhQ84956","name":"Take","artist":"iRpCbdcc2"},{"id":"nmTUkG85ef0","name":"Encore","artist":"8jlQk1ee421"},{"id":"kiRPcab40","name":"SUPER MARIO HISTORY 1985-2010 ...","artist":"GKX68abb"},{"id":"kCc614d89","name":"Night Visions","artist":"NhF6f9e0"},{"id":"nnd26259c88","name":"Collage","artist":"iUylaf308"},{"id":"nnh1ML82189","name":"Friendships","artist":"nn9Ywk6ec63"}],"artists":[{"id":"8Oz5571c","name":"Owl City"},{"id":"dv4Y34ea9","name":"Lana Del Rey"},{"id":"bsEsfa74d","name":"Backstreet Boys"},{"id":"bicrb4f0f","name":"Ellie Goulding"},{"id":"dzwH40ebf","name":"Daft Punk"},{"id":"blrrd31d0","name":"Avicii"},{"id":"ecUI723af","name":"The xx"},{"id":"hVmHo73090","name":"Alan Walker"},{"id":"hd5c8555","name":"椎名林檎"},{"id":"fZg05q26f0e","name":"majestic"},{"id":"7kI7403c","name":"David Guetta"},{"id":"xipZJYaf739","name":"燕池"}],"styles":[{"type":"style","id":"8","name":"电子舞曲 EDM / Electronic Dance Music","description":"电子舞曲（Electronic Dance Music）是各种电子音乐的合称，它们的用途往往是在舞厅、派对里用来作跳舞的背景音乐。 电子舞曲流派分为 House、Techno、Trance、Big Beat、Drum `N` Bass、Break Beat和Big Beat、Reggae/Ska、Old school/Miami beat、R`N`B、Tribal、Mambo、Cha Cha、Hip House等等。\n\nElectronic dance music (also known as EDM, dance music,club music, or simply dance) is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. EDM is generally produced for playback by disc jockeys (DJs) who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by segueing from one recording to another.[4] EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA. In Europe, EDM is more commonly called 'dance music' or simply 'dance'.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the emergence of raving, pirate radio, and an upsurge of interest in club culture, EDM acquired mainstream popularity in Europe. In the United States at that time acceptance of dance culture was not universal, and although both Electro and Chicago house music were hugely influential both in Europe and the USA, mainstream media outlets, and the record industry, remained hostile to EDM. There was also a perceived association between EDM and drug culture which led governments at state and city level to enact laws and policies intended to halt the spread of rave culture.\n\nSubsequently, in the new millennium, the popularity of EDM increased globally, including the United States. By the early 2010s, the term \"electronic dance music\" and the initialism \"EDM\" was being pushed by the United States music industry and music press in an effort to rebrand American rave culture. Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the initialism remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including house, techno, trance, drum and bass, dubstep, and their respective subgenres.","songs":[{"id":"mQXZxz7a707","name":"Let Me Love You","artist":"bgZGd035c"},{"id":"mSqZde623aa","name":"Something Just Like This","artist":"iUylaf308"},{"id":"bCmtmHE6cdfa","name":"JULY","artist":"cPNxKec8cab"},{"id":"xNbYKwa30a8","name":"Stay","artist":"eC2Ce0bba"},{"id":"xNfXhpad57d","name":"Papillon","artist":"yhD0G6c8316"},{"id":"U5HOW8264d2","name":"Wake Me Up","artist":"blrrd31d0"},{"id":"8HSD4zfe747","name":"Wolves","artist":"mUCFYy87238"},{"id":"xL9QNKc4e22","name":"Lean On","artist":"bgsadb57e"},{"id":"bqwNoO6589ea","name":"Solo Dance","artist":"URUrDS2ae72"},{"id":"bClbIGb4998a","name":"Hymn For The Weekend (Alan Walker Remix)","artist":"hVmHo73090"},{"id":"b1r9LRp3f0de","name":"It Ain't Me","artist":"nevURE54750"},{"id":"xLHP9ub347b","name":"How to Love","artist":"EUL902fe"}],"albums":[{"id":"yhOOZ6bbb12","name":"Something Just Like This","artist":"iUylaf308"},{"id":"nmTUkG85ef0","name":"Encore","artist":"8jlQk1ee421"},{"id":"nnd26259c88","name":"Collage","artist":"iUylaf308"},{"id":"cxnU9Vcbf8a","name":"True","artist":"blrrd31d0"},{"id":"JXkf9E1eaf9","name":"Stories","artist":"blrrd31d0"},{"id":"nicmeOd1593","name":"True Colors","artist":"eC2Ce0bba"},{"id":"9cAkgKf48eb","name":"Papillon","artist":"yhD0G6c8316"},{"id":"JXuzhb227cb","name":"JULY","artist":"cPNxKec8cab"},{"id":"nndGLO935e5","name":"Stay","artist":"eC2Ce0bba"},{"id":"xVOgjKa8dee","name":"Lean On","artist":"bgsadb57e"},{"id":"nmTJsw8e06c","name":"Blood, Sweat & 3 Years","artist":"EUL902fe"},{"id":"9czQ6R180e7","name":"Hymn For The Weekend (Alan Wal...","artist":"hVmHo73090"}],"artists":[{"id":"blrrd31d0","name":"Avicii"},{"id":"hVmHo73090","name":"Alan Walker"},{"id":"7kI7403c","name":"David Guetta"},{"id":"eC2Ce0bba","name":"Zedd"},{"id":"65N6285b","name":"Calvin Harris"},{"id":"cci8JZ83a2f","name":"Martin Garrix"},{"id":"bDtEWx7300c","name":"Kygo"},{"id":"bgsadb57e","name":"Major Lazer"},{"id":"bhuI1505f","name":"Steve Aoki"},{"id":"8jlQk1ee421","name":"DJ Snake"},{"id":"mUCFYy87238","name":"Marshmello"},{"id":"eF4J87950","name":"Alesso"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3348","name":"未来贝斯 Future Bass","description":"未来贝斯是在2006年出现的一种新音乐风格，从Trap音乐演变出来，在英国、美国、中国、日本、澳大利亚较为流行。特点是低音（bassline）较重，音色很尖十分跳脱。作为一个相对还在发展的风格，未来贝斯还未定型，同时受到Trap，footwork 和UK garage的影响。\n\n\nFuture bass is a music genre that arose around 2006 in the United Kingdom, United States, China, Japan, and Australia.

The sound waves are often modulated using automation or low-frequency oscillation controlling the cutoff of an audio filter (typically a low pass or high pass filter) making the waveform sound louder or quieter. In addition, it is common to find the utilization of a sort of \"twinkly\" sounding rise (gradual rise in pitch), including arpeggio chords, and vocoders.\nThe future bass genre stems from trap, footwork and UK garage.

DISCO流行后，一些DJ将它改变，有心将DISCO变得较为不商业化， BASS和鼓变得更深沈， 很多时变成了纯音乐作品，即使有歌唱部分也多数是由跳舞女歌手唱的简短句子，往往没有明确歌词。 渐渐的，有人加入了LATIN(拉丁)、 REGGAE(瑞格源在西印度群岛)、 RAP(说唱)或 JAZZ(爵士)等元素， 至八十年代后期， HOUSE冲出地下范围，成为芝加哥、纽约及伦敦流行榜的宠儿。 \n\nCher唱的Believe 就是个好例子.而M-People可说是House代表团体.House舞曲在1986年开始流行后,可说是取代了Disco音乐. \n\nHouse可分为： \n\nAcid House 也就是融合了TB-303的Acid声的House乐 \n\nDeep House 有着相当浓厚的灵魂唱腔,又叫作Garage,蛮流行化的. 像Real Mecoy, M-People, La Bouche都是Garage团体. \n\nHard House 简单来说,就是节奏较重,较猛的House. \n\nProgressive House 这类House没啥灵魂唱腔,反而比较注重旋律和乐曲编排.有一 点像\"演奏类\"的House乐. 像SASH!的专辑It''s My Life便是很好的Progressive House专辑. \n\nEpic House 就是\"史诗\"House.

After disco became popular, certain urban DJs -- particularly those in gay communities -- altered the music to make it less pop-oriented. The beat became more mechanical and the bass grooves became deeper, while elements of electronic synth pop, Latin soul, dub reggae, rap, and jazz were grafted over the music's insistent, unvarying four-four beat. Frequently, the music was purely instrumental and when there were vocalists, they were faceless female divas that often sang wordless melodies. By the late '80s, house had broken out of underground clubs in cities like Chicago, New York, and London, and had begun making inroads on the pop charts, particularly in England and Europe but later in America under the guise of artists like C+C Music Factory and Madonna. At the same time, house was breaking into the pop charts; it fragmented into a number of subgenres, including hip-house, ambient house, and most significantly, acid house (a subgenre of house with the instantly recognizable squelch of Roland's TB-303 bass-line generator). During the '90s, house ceased to be cutting-edge music, yet it remained popular in clubs throughout Europe and America. At the end of the decade, a new wave of progressive house artists including Daft Punk, Basement Jaxx, and House of 909 brought the music back to critical quarters with praised full-length works.","songs":[{"id":"mSJxp511cc1","name":"Friendships (Original Mix)","artist":"nn9Ywk6ec63"},{"id":"U5HOW8264d2","name":"Wake Me Up","artist":"blrrd31d0"},{"id":"mQI2vp7c873","name":"Toca Toca (Radio Edit)","artist":"boyG10110"},{"id":"xL2MPib1055","name":"Rather Be","artist":"xMVzuad28b2"},{"id":"mSscZq85fc6","name":"Boom (Original Mix)","artist":"de4C35ce5"},{"id":"xLHP9ub347b","name":"How to Love","artist":"EUL902fe"},{"id":"xL4PL812d00","name":"I See Fire (Kygo Remix)","artist":"bDtEWx7300c"},{"id":"xL6g1w9c4ef","name":"Sunburst","artist":"bEsoL285758"},{"id":"bCkDrXz781f2","name":"Titanium","artist":"7kI7403c"},{"id":"bCkMkEI4a88e","name":"Changes","artist":"IPk4c175"},{"id":"JAZFHq21af9","name":"Summer","artist":"65N6285b"},{"id":"bf0IIy82f310","name":"Faded（LaRry Rong Remix）","artist":"cthqyId02e9"}],"albums":[{"id":"nnh1ML82189","name":"Friendships","artist":"nn9Ywk6ec63"},{"id":"cxnU9Vcbf8a","name":"True","artist":"blrrd31d0"},{"id":"JXkf9E1eaf9","name":"Stories","artist":"blrrd31d0"},{"id":"bpOKc2F392d1","name":"New Eyes","artist":"d9eF67fae73"},{"id":"bqHBHJq3767f","name":"Boom","artist":"de4C35ce5"},{"id":"7X5Fcl1aae6","name":"Motion","artist":"65N6285b"},{"id":"nmTJsw8e06c","name":"Blood, Sweat & 3 Years","artist":"EUL902fe"},{"id":"dkreXDdc27e","name":"Sunburst","artist":"eNMjgH1fe4e"},{"id":"8HTxA9f5b06","name":"I See Fire (Kygo Remix)","artist":"bDtEWx7300c"},{"id":"4OE7381b4","name":"One Love","artist":"7kI7403c"},{"id":"czmFNoc2852","name":"Life","artist":"eNMjgH1fe4e"},{"id":"bmLlSF11cd0","name":"Higher","artist":"eNMjgH1fe4e"}],"artists":[{"id":"dzwH40ebf","name":"Daft Punk"},{"id":"blrrd31d0","name":"Avicii"},{"id":"fZg05q26f0e","name":"majestic"},{"id":"7kI7403c","name":"David Guetta"},{"id":"eC2Ce0bba","name":"Zedd"},{"id":"65N6285b","name":"Calvin Harris"},{"id":"cci8JZ83a2f","name":"Martin Garrix"},{"id":"eNMjgH1fe4e","name":"Tobu"},{"id":"Trjd2110","name":"The Chemical Brothers"},{"id":"d9eF67fae73","name":"Clean Bandit"},{"id":"b4u1f5fb2","name":"deadmau5"},{"id":"nmSu6U4d592","name":"陈柯宇"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1010","name":"合成器流行 Synthpop","description":"Synth Pop中的 \" Synth\"，即 Synthesizer(合成器)，顾名思义， Synth Pop就是“由 Sythesizrs炮制出来的流行乐”，当然除 Synthesizers外还会用上其他电子乐器如电脑及鼓机等等。 Synth Pop於八十年代初期开始流行，至八十年代中开始沉寂，当年在香港也曾掀起过一阵热潮。 Synth Pop的特点是科技感强，有时会颇冰冷，歌曲多是“三分钟流行曲” (3-minutes Pop)，很多时 Synth Pop乐手会作入时打扮。\nSynthpop (also known as electropop, or technopop) is a genre of popular music that first became prominent in the 1980s, in which the synthesizer is the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic art rock, disco and particularly the \"Kraut rock\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the New Wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.Early synthpop pioneers included Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra and British bands Ultravox and the Human League; the latter largely used monophonic synthesizers to produce music with a simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of Tubeway Army and Gary Numan in the British Singles Chart, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including Soft Cell, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Japan and Depeche Mode in the United Kingdom, while in Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success opened the way for synthpop bands such as P-Model, Plastics, and Hikashu. The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers, the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synthpop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synthpop acts, including Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, in the United States.In the late 1980s, duos such as Erasure and Pet Shop Boys adopted a sound that was highly successful on the US dance charts, but by the end of the decade synthpop had largely been abandoned. Interest began to be revived in the indie electronic and electroclash movements in the late 1990s and, in the first decade of the 21st century, it enjoyed a widespread revival with commercial success for acts including La Roux and Owl City.Synthpop received criticism for its limited and artificial sound and for its associations with alternative sexualities. It helped to establish the place of the synthesiser as a major element of pop and rock music, directly influenced subsequent genres including house music and Detroit techno, and has indirectly influenced many other genres and individual recordings.","songs":[{"id":"mSuWMD532c9","name":"Look What You Made Me Do","artist":"6iJ73478"},{"id":"xL0ugUcda63","name":"Get Lucky","artist":"dcn739570"},{"id":"JAWHma242bc","name":"Safe and Sound","artist":"iR3Jd2a02"},{"id":"mQWxUC77c1f","name":"Down","artist":"hXPmkr34c09"},{"id":"xLomclf4ac2","name":"Got 2 Let U","artist":"6L1827b3"},{"id":"8GcfGVf636b","name":"Tennis Elbow","artist":"bAb3ec68e"},{"id":"mQOE6U61823","name":"Blue Skies","artist":"CTI60914"},{"id":"U3ts8a296","name":"Lullaby ","artist":"ciHW27f4d"},{"id":"xLusKWd5b70","name":"Midnight City","artist":"Wnlacbab"},{"id":"mQOkE8a56d2","name":"King","artist":"hrFUcy31e40"},{"id":"bCkTnsI467be","name":"Awoo","artist":"JjMdCp2599e"},{"id":"cQJxH1e34a","name":"Kids","artist":"WsMd3b63"}],"albums":[{"id":"c3ogJ8cede6","name":"Random Access Memories","artist":"dzwH40ebf"},{"id":"1fAH4aa79","name":"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming","artist":"Wnlacbab"},{"id":"bPa28H4e511","name":"In a Tidal Wave of Mystery","artist":"iR3Jd2a02"},{"id":"PTQ57360","name":"Discovery","artist":"dzwH40ebf"},{"id":"eWAz90231","name":"Deep Cuts","artist":"6L1827b3"},{"id":"jH5Wae4bd","name":"Galore: The Singles 1987-1997","artist":"ciHW27f4d"},{"id":"nmT8XK6a61f","name":"Junk","artist":"Wnlacbab"},{"id":"r4Ns24fea","name":"Crystal Castles","artist":"bwoh16a4f"},{"id":"ntfZe28d9","name":"Oracular Spectacular","artist":"WsMd3b63"},{"id":"cSeWZDdc533","name":"This Summer's Gonna Hurt Like ...","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"mjk2wD6746a","name":"Currents","artist":"b90Ff35c6"},{"id":"wx9c2cdbb","name":"Music For Men","artist":"WGh970c7"}],"artists":[{"id":"dzwH40ebf","name":"Daft Punk"},{"id":"bfMFs3G2ec31","name":"Billie Eilish"},{"id":"6i26aa9b","name":"Vitas"},{"id":"bwoh16a4f","name":"Crystal Castles"},{"id":"cz8G25c76","name":"Hurts"},{"id":"WsMd3b63","name":"MGMT"},{"id":"bts9fb246","name":"Kraftwerk"},{"id":"SJTc1be1","name":"Pet Shop Boys"},{"id":"Wnlacbab","name":"M83"},{"id":"b2q3e42c0","name":"Jay-Jay Johanson"},{"id":"2Cm7d7df","name":"ABBA"},{"id":"bxvQe84de","name":"Goldfrapp"}]},{"type":"style","id":"947","name":"独立电子乐 Indietronica","description":"独立电子乐（indietronica 或 indie electronic）是一种综合了独立音乐（英语：indie）、电子乐（英语：electronica）、摇滚（英语：rock）和流行（英语：pop）音乐风格的音乐流派。并伴随着录音/采样技术以及多媒体音乐技术(电脑音乐创作，即Laptop Music)的不断发展而有不同方向上的演绎，电子技术与不同的音乐风格元素相互融合衍生出众多繁杂的电子乐分支，在独立音乐中，独立电子大体上是说那些大量应用采样/拼贴音乐技术，而作品整体上却仍然具有传统的曲式架构(这和很多实验前卫的电子音乐不同)，如娇好的旋律、激赏的节奏等。\n\n特征\n独立电子乐中使用的典型乐器是电子琴、合成器、采样器、MIDI控制器和电子鼓等。这类作品在保证不失基本的聆听趣味下，会以各种多彩丰富的电子手法赋予作品独具各色魅力的音乐特色-或飘逸、或空灵、或清凉、或奇幻、或嬗变……从聆听趣味的角度看，独立电子音乐正在为我们拓展出一片极为宽广的聆赏选择空间，这个宽广的真实意义在于小电音乐的创作手法将极大地降低年轻人创作音乐的门槛，很多的独立电子音乐作品创作的物理实体就是一台笔记本电脑，而存于硬盘中的大量音乐素材(有专业的素材库，也可以自己于周遭生活中进行录音)在专业音乐软件的应用中被给予各种变异、剪切以及拼帖等折衷主义色彩的创作手法，这便形成了聆听趣味异彩纷呈的独立电子音乐特色风景。\n\n流行时段\n2000年后\n\n英文简介\nLess a style and more a categorization, Indie Electronic refers to rock-rooted artists who followed early electronic composers (especially the BBC Radiophonic Workshop), Krautrock, synth pop, and dance music by using synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, and computer programs.

The music website Allmusic has described its overall sound as \"tightly coiled productions with overwhelming bass lines and reverberant drum patterns, clipped samples, and occasional vocals\".\nThe earliest dubstep releases date back to 1998 and were darker, more experimental, instrumental dub remixes of 2-step garage tracks attempting to incorporate the funky elements of breakbeat, or the dark elements of drum and bass into 2-step, which featured as B-sides of single releases. In 2001, this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the \"Forward\" night (sometimes stylized as FWD>>), which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term \"dubstep\" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple, Ammunition and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and grime. \nA very early supporter of the sound was BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who started playing it from 2003 onwards. In 2004, the last year of his show, his listeners voted Distance, Digital Mystikz and Plastician (formerly Plasticman) in their top 50 for the year. Dubstep started to spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006; many websites devoted to the genre appeared on the internet and aided the growth of the scene, such as dubstepforum, the download site Barefiles and blogs such as gutterbreakz. Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as The Wire and online publications such as Pitchfork Media, with a regular feature entitled The Month In: Grime/Dubstep. Interest in dubstep grew significantly after BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs started championing the genre, beginning with a show devoted to it (entitled \"Dubstep Warz\") in January 2006.\nTowards the end of the decade the genre started to become more commercially successful in the UK, with more singles and remixes entering the music charts. Music journalists and critics also noticed a dubstep influence in several pop artists' work. Around this time, producers also began to fuse elements of the original dubstep sound with other influences, creating fusion genres including the slower and more experimental post-dubstep, and the harsher, electro house and heavy metal influenced brostep, the latter of which greatly contributed to dubstep's rising mainstream popularity in the United States.","songs":[{"id":"b1pYNj83fa75","name":"Open

Shake让几乎所有人听到了Trap这种音乐，但是Trap音乐究竟是什么？毒品？Purple drank？美女和大麻？如果要让我解释，我的答案是: “Trap是一种极强的snare与浸泡过可待因的传统南部脏Bass自然的结合出的音乐，它将油腻的滴答声甩进了那些沉重的伴奏，人声以及鼓声中，无疑是最淫荡的一种音乐” 如果说我的形容是经过深思熟虑或者略显专业，那Mad Decent的Dirty South Joe给出了最直白的一种答案“Trap音乐是真正的Hip-Hop音乐和跳舞音乐结合而成的一种音乐方式，没人去特意的发明它，只是自然而然的形成了” 那么，Trap是什么意思？ UrbanDic给出了专业的答案 “the act of going to a place in order to make money byselling drugs or other items, most often illegally. common areas are busystreet corners, shopping centers, aparment complexes, and any place of commonlylarge gatherings of people.” 也就是说Trap是指黑人为了生存或更好的生活去贩卖毒品赚钱的行为，也有意指贩毒的地方。所以，Trap出身极其卑微，几乎仅由一部分黑人所喜好和传播，就像DavidDrake说的“Trap在2000年以前根本不是一种音乐风格，它是一个真实的地方” DJ Scream告诉了我们它与音乐的联系，Trap是个开心的地方（因为 ‘The area where drug deals arecarried ou’），所以Trap音乐就是代表一种开心的音乐，当低频响起，所有的一切都是这样一种节奏和氛围。这样的话，也不难理解Trap音乐给人的感觉，因为Trap本身就是一种生活方式，像UGK, Lex Luger, T.I., Rick Ross, Lil Webbie, BunB这样的有关金钱，汽车，美女，舞蹈与奋斗，自然而然充满了油腻，而这些生活方式的存在远比Trap音乐的发展要早很多，如果你知道UGK，你就明白，传统的南部音乐早在80年代就已经形成 如果说真正将Trap音乐推向主流或大众，首先应该感谢的人则是T.I.，很多人知道Trap这个词是从他的第二张专辑”Trap Muzik”开始，而这张专辑的制作人我们看到了现在大名鼎鼎的Diplo，Flosstradamus,Dillon Francis, Flux Pavillion, Rustie, Baauer等等这样的连接着EDM圈子的音乐人和DJ。而之后的Lex Luger则更近了一步，除了为RickRoss制作的B.M.F.还有大名鼎鼎的Kanye West的H.A.M以及Waka Flocka Flame的音乐，而在此时Trap已开始趋向流行化。到了2011年和2012年，除了涌现了808Mafia, Southside, Young Chop这样的Trap音乐以外，更出现了两位牛逼的音乐制作人MikeWiLL Made It和AraabMuzik，他们不仅将Trap推广，更是将R&B与电子音乐和Trap音乐结合，此后更是有了Chief Keef，Future等现在炙手可热的音乐人出现，而同时Trap逐渐登上电子音乐的舞台，被Diplo,Flosstradamus, Baauer这样的音乐人传播，从“Acid Trap”,”Trap-ah-ton”，“TrapStep”这样的叫法到“新Dubstep”直到现在的“EDM Trap”，无疑说明受到更多的青睐。取代了毒品交易和汽车金钱，EDM Trap更接近于club音乐，这样就使得出现了两种争论，归属于EDM还是Hip-Hop。其实未必需要争论，Trap音乐本身就是拥有争议且无法脱离任何一点 (不论EDM或Hip-Hop) 的音乐，就像是Flosstradamus曾经被禁止在Chicago表演，因为他的演出曾出现暴乱，这好像只有摇滚和Hip-Hop现场能看到的景象，这也说明了现代的Trap仍然具有很强的Hip-Hop成分 不管怎么样，Trap音乐是现在炙手可热的音乐风格之一，甚至Diplo已经在BBC上开始了他的固定Trap电台节目，可想而知，Trap的浪潮已经开始。当你听到Miley Cyrus在23中唱 “J’s on my feet”或2Chainz的各种大热单曲甚至M.I.A的音乐时，你可能不会知道，这就是Trap，但是它却无处不在。不论你说它是一种新的音乐，它可能会很快消失，但我相信现在的DJ和音乐人会不断创造改进并找到自己的对于Trap的定位，重新诠释这种音乐，对于电子音乐这个校园来说，毕竟Trap还是个新生。最后，当你听到一首Trap音乐时，别忘了说“Damn Son, Where’dYa Find This!!!” ―—资料来源：Bloodz Boi-怎样定义TRAP MUSIC？(http://www.zhihu.com/question/22157912)","songs":[{"id":"mQIbMg90752","name":"Turn Down For What","artist":"A1o883de"},{"id":"xL999Qb42e8","name":"Where Are

Despite waning interest in the sound during the mid-'90s, trance made a big comeback later in the decade, even supplanting house as the most popular dance music of choice around the globe.\n\nInspired by acid house and Detroit techno, trance coalesced with the opening of R&S Records in Ghent, Belgium and Harthouse/Eye Q Records in Frankfurt, Germany. R&S defined the sound early on with singles like \"Energy Flash\" by Joey Beltram, \"The Ravesignal\" by CJ Bolland, and others by Robert Leiner, Sun Electric, and Aphex Twin. Harthouse, begun in 1992 by Sven Väth with Heinz Roth &Matthias Hoffman, made the most impact on the sound of trance with Hardfloor's minimal epic \"Hardtrance Acperience\" and Väth's own \"L'Esperanza,\" plus releases by Arpeggiators, Spicelab, and Barbarella. Artists like Väth, Bolland, Leiner, and many others made the transition to the full-length realm, though without much of an impact on the wider music world.\n\nDespite a long nascent period when it appeared trance had disappeared, replaced by breakbeat dance (trip-hop and jungle), the style's increasing impact on Britain's dance scene finally crested in the late '90s. The classic German sound had changed somewhat though, and the term \"progressive\" trance gained favor to describe influences from the smoother end of house and Euro dance. By 1998, most of the country's best-known DJs -- Paul Oakenfold, Pete Tong, Tony De Vit, Danny Rampling, Sasha, Judge Jules -- were playing trance in Britain's superclubs. Even America turned on to the sound (eventually), led by its own cast of excellent DJs, including Christopher Lawrence and Kimball Collins.","songs":[{"id":"bf02iMq3074e","name":"This Is What It Feels Like","artist":"dd1D34c63"},{"id":"ck7t6ecf7d","name":"Ecstasy","artist":"Uawc759e"},{"id":"xL4ZMZcd2ed","name":"Wasted","artist":"nfMhf4fb8"},{"id":"RcqQ93792","name":"Everytime We Touch","artist":"9Ii5044f"},{"id":"bf0snez328ad","name":"Right Back (Original Mix)","artist":"OVI5353c"},{"id":"mQ5s107b216","name":"Closer","artist":"biNxa6145"},{"id":"d39LT29437","name":"Crush","artist":"Tsx15623"},{"id":"8G4FDMfbdb4","name":"Heartbeat","artist":"b1zP4WF3d678"},{"id":"fFfG9436ba","name":"Ruhe","artist":"bfRjbef0a"},{"id":"8GgA9Hffa9e","name":"Kiss of Life","artist":"F8g5b787"},{"id":"b4SF0d0321","name":"Sirens of the Sea","artist":"6uv68f0f"},{"id":"b1pUc3G3eb77","name":"Welcome to St. Tropez (Houseshaker Radio Edit)","artist":"MLV74b7b"}],"albums":[{"id":"b0O1UUc3ca25","name":"Intense","artist":"dd1D34c63"},{"id":"juXebbe75","name":"Everytime We Touch","artist":"9Ii5044f"},{"id":"keroc7855","name":"Mirage","artist":"dd1D34c63"},{"id":"eKD0915ad","name":"No Silence","artist":"Uawc759e"},{"id":"sR6u21a0e","name":"Welcome to DJ Antoine","artist":"MLV74b7b"},{"id":"eVgC86df8","name":"Sirens of the Sea","artist":"At554a80"},{"id":"fLlW541d2","name":"Once Upon A Night","artist":"VTHcb1bf"},{"id":"bzJP4K95f3a","name":"电音谜","artist":"dbEQesce8a9"},{"id":"xwi4MFd33a5","name":"Wasted","artist":"de4C35ce5"},{"id":"mgEXSx5d118","name":"Vonyc Sessions 2013","artist":"Tsx15623"},{"id":"na5118c12","name":"Reflections","artist":"Tsx15623"},{"id":"08CE334d8","name":"Voyage","artist":"bfRjbef0a"}],"artists":[{"id":"de4C35ce5","name":"Tiësto"},{"id":"dd1D34c63","name":"Armin van Buuren"},{"id":"VZUdf899","name":"Infected Mushroom"},{"id":"Uawc759e","name":"ATB"},{"id":"Tsx15623","name":"Paul van Dyk"},{"id":"dzww41afd","name":"Aphex Twin"},{"id":"9Ii5044f","name":"Cascada"},{"id":"bj2Pc1200","name":"M2U"},{"id":"At554a80","name":"Above & Beyond"},{"id":"3To4d8bb","name":"BT"},{"id":"bkUOb5a90","name":"I've"},{"id":"VTHcb1bf","name":"Ferry Corsten"}]},{"type":"style","id":"44","name":"前卫浩室 Progressive House","description":"Progressive House前卫浩室，是浩室音乐的一个分支，在4/4拍子的基础上，注重整体的进行和编排，以及整体情绪的推进，优美的旋律也是这个音乐风格重要的一环。Progressive house的根源可以追溯到20世纪90年代初英国，后传播到欧洲，澳大利亚,北美的锐舞和俱乐部现场.在这个时代与US house, UK house, Italian house, German house, and Techno互相影响.在早期Progressive house这个词标签经常与Trance交换使用.在当时锐舞兴旺时期的英国俱乐部Progressive house一词经常作为反锐舞的标签。\n\nProgressive house is a style (subgenre) of house music. The progressive house style emerged in the early 1990s. It initially developed in the United Kingdom as a natural progression of American and European house music of the late 1980s。\n\nProgressive house emerged after the first wave of house music. The roots of progressive house can be traced back to the early 1990s rave and club scenes in the United Kingdom. In 1992, Mixmag described it at the time as a \"new breed of hard but tuneful, banging but thoughtful, uplifting and trancey British house.\" A combination of US house, UK house, Italian house, German house, and techno largely influenced one another during this era. The term was used mainly as a marketing label to differentiate new rave house from traditional American house. Progressive house was a departure from the Chicago acid house sound. The buzz word emerged from the rave scene around 1990 to 1992, describing a new sound of house that broke away from its American roots. Progressive house was viewed by some as anti-rave as its popularity rose in English clubs while breakbeat hardcore flourished at raves.According to DJ Dave Seaman, the sound faced a backlash in the early 1990s because “it had gone the same way as progressive rock before it. Pompous, po-faced and full of its own self importance. But basically was really quite boring.\"The label progressive house was often used interchangeably with trance in the early years","songs":[{"id":"U5HOW8264d2","name":"Wake Me Up","artist":"blrrd31d0"},{"id":"xL6g1w9c4ef","name":"Sunburst","artist":"bEsoL285758"},{"id":"xLyq4Mcaa34","name":"Don't You Worry Child (Radio Edit)","artist":"bkv1b9255"},{"id":"xL700b21f19","name":"Heroes","artist":"eF4J87950"},{"id":"8G4FEafae0b","name":"Years (Korean Ver.)","artist":"ga7ofX2a6fb"},{"id":"mSeAor5b737","name":"I Wanna Know","artist":"eF4J87950"},{"id":"JC6DB91e96f","name":"This Girl (Kungs Vs.

Where house still had explicit connection to disco even when it was entirely mechanical, techno was strictly electronic music, designed for a small, specific audience. The first techno producers and DJs -- Kevin Saunderson, Juan Atkins, and Derrick May, among others -- emphasized the electronic, synthesized beats of electro-funk artists like Afrika Bambaataa and synth-rock units like Kraftwerk. In the United States, techno was strictly an underground phenomenon, but in England, it broke into the mainstream in the late '80s. In the early '90s, techno began to fragment into a number of subgenres, including hardcore, ambient, and jungle. In hardcore techno, the beats-per-minute on each record were sped up to ridiculous, undanceable levels -- it was designed to alienate a broad audience. Ambient took the opposite direction, slowing the beats down and relying on watery electronic textures -- it was used as come-down music, when ravers and club-goers needed a break from acid house and hardcore techno. Jungle was nearly as aggressive as hardcore, combining driving techno beats with breakbeats and dancehall reggae -- essentially. All subgenres of techno were initially designed to be played in clubs, where they would be mixed by DJs. Consequently, most of the music was available on 12-inch singles or various-artists compilations, where the songs could run for a long time, providing the DJ with a lot of material to mix into his set. In the mid-'90s, a new breed of techno artists -- most notably ambient acts like the Orb and Aphex Twin, but also harder-edged artists like the Prodigy and Goldie -- began constructing albums that didn't consist of raw beats intended for mixing. Not surprisingly, these artists -- particularly the Prodigy -- became the first recognizable stars in techno.","songs":[{"id":"JAN2LX245b5","name":"Swoon (Lindstrøm & Prins Thomas Remix)","artist":"Trjd2110"},{"id":"b13kFf3540","name":"Extreme Ways","artist":"TrO9fd70"},{"id":"b4YwY1a4d5","name":"Operate","artist":"W3Lbd3df"},{"id":"UP1k4e9e3","name":"No Turning Back","artist":"dfEl38c03"},{"id":"b1GR3d3e90","name":"Sola Sistim","artist":"3r2cee93"},{"id":"b9Vx9a6299","name":"Brazil (2nd Edit) ","artist":"b4u1f5fb2"},{"id":"LgjL80156","name":"Suliman [145 BPM]","artist":"VZUdf899"},{"id":"b42ABac283","name":"Senorita Tristeza","artist":"cmfS2c26e"},{"id":"mQPekg6f67d","name":"Premiere Classe (Beat Mix)","artist":"nnbraS9b89b"},{"id":"mQ59sY533c8","name":"You","artist":"bxo4f16cc"},{"id":"xLqGaud85d4","name":"Crush","artist":"WtDaf48a"},{"id":"cq8ZSe4946","name":"Omen","artist":"c9vF2ffa4"}],"albums":[{"id":"kdF42a869","name":"Another World","artist":"Trjd2110"},{"id":"eCRN601e9","name":"Vicious Delicious","artist":"VZUdf899"},{"id":"bFZAf9fed","name":"18","artist":"TrO9fd70"},{"id":"eVBU7f9aa","name":"Fatherfucker","artist":"W3Lbd3df"},{"id":"jEKEa61b4","name":"Random Album Title","artist":"b4u1f5fb2"},{"id":"jJqxd8409","name":"Take My Breath Away","artist":"dfEl38c03"},{"id":"fNo8829c1","name":"Immersion","artist":"WtDaf48a"},{"id":"STAde92b","name":"一朵金花","artist":"iuzfce26"},{"id":"w9mH2b88c","name":"Dust","artist":"bxo4f16cc"},{"id":"eC1R7b28b","name":"The Line of Nine","artist":"cmfS2c26e"},{"id":"vyNx28361","name":"A   Hundred Days Off","artist":"3r2cee93"},{"id":"iPPx108a0","name":"Suzuki","artist":"bvVRf7085"}],"artists":[{"id":"Trjd2110","name":"The Chemical Brothers"},{"id":"b4u1f5fb2","name":"deadmau5"},{"id":"bts9fb246","name":"Kraftwerk"},{"id":"3r2cee93","name":"Underworld"},{"id":"dzww41afd","name":"Aphex Twin"},{"id":"c9vF2ffa4","name":"The Prodigy"},{"id":"dfEl38c03","name":"Gui Boratto"},{"id":"nlLttr61307","name":"BinchOuTan"},{"id":"b7Ku6086b","name":"Koan"},{"id":"bxo4f16cc","name":"Ellen Allien"},{"id":"bj2Pc1200","name":"M2U"},{"id":"bw7Ae4f06","name":"Bassnectar"}]},{"type":"style","id":"730","name":"氛围音乐 Ambient","description":"什么是氛围音乐\nAmbient（氛围音乐）源于70年代艺术家们的一种实验性的电子合成音乐，代表人物如Brian Eno、Kraftwerk以及Harold Budd，同时也具有80年代trance风格的数码舞蹈乐曲。氛围音乐是一种有足够空间让人发挥的有着声波结构的电子音乐。它没有作词或作曲的束缚。尽管艺术家在创作之间有暗示性的差异，但对于偶然一次的听众来说，它只是不断地在重复和没有变化的声音。\n\nAmbient music evolved from the experimental electronic music of '70s synth-based artists like Brian Eno and Kraftwerk, and the trance-like techno dance music of the '80s.

Bass","description":"Jungle承袭了Hardcore的精神，听起来很〝硬〞，其碎拍更是迷人，也常出现一些Rap，使Jungle有很重的黑人味（其实早期许多Jungle乐手都是黑人）。基本上，要做出又快又复杂的节拍任何人都会，但如何在复杂且快速的节奏中，让听众了解〝你到底在做什么〞，就不是件容易事了。 一些Jungle先锋如Goldie等人，其对于节拍建构的功力真是一等一。 \n　　 \n　　相较于Jungle，约95年左右出现的Drum''n''Bass，则结合了Jazz乐风，柔和了许多。顾名思义，Drum''n''Bass就是著重于鼓声和低音的表现。鼓声可能全部采用电子合成，也可能取样自真实鼓声。而它的Bass声则是显得格外巨大，有时声音还会扩散开来。但Drum''n''Bass音乐也可能清一色使用鼓声，然后将大鼓的声音用效果器〝压扁〞成Bass声。这类低音相当有压迫感，有点撞击的感觉，耳朵很容易听出来。但也有乐团有时使用真实的低音大提琴负责低音部份，如英国的4 Hero乐团。 \n\n　　虽说Drum''n''Bass有如Jungle的改良，但它俩其实界线不是非常明确。若是你听到曲子的节拍又快又复杂，或是很难抓它的节奏感，那可能就是Jungle/Drum''n''Bass了。\n\nBased almost entirely in England, Jungle (also known as drum'n'bass) is a permutation of hardcore techno that emerged in the early '90s. Jungle is the most rhythmically complex of all forms of techno, relying on extremely fast polyrhythms and breakbeats. Usually, it's entirely instrumental -- it is among the hardest of all hardcore techno, often consisting of nothing but fast drum machines and deep bass. As its name implies, jungle does have more overt reggae, dub, and R&B influences than most hardcore -- and that is why some critics claimed that the music was the sound of black techno musicians and DJs reclaiming it from the white musicians and DJs who dominated the hardcore scene. Like most techno genres, jungle is primarily a singles genre designed for a small, dedicated audience, although the crossover successes of Goldie (with his 1995 debut Timeless) and Roni Size (with the Mercury Award-winning New Forms) suggested a broader appeal and more musical possibilities than other forms of techno. Dozens of respected artists followed in their wake, fusing breakbeat with influences lifted from jazz, film music, ambient, and trip-hop.","songs":[{"id":"bCkUhtR4a0d9","name":"河流","artist":"eGEa5b23b"},{"id":"b1pZOTN3ca5d","name":"Turn Back Time","artist":"dD2142cb9"},{"id":"xLqGaud85d4","name":"Crush","artist":"WtDaf48a"},{"id":"xL9JbTa53f8","name":"朴树 - 平凡之路 (Skey Remix) (Nov 14, 2014)","artist":"ddCvDgd2e55"},{"id":"esFYJ349b3","name":"Nanou 2","artist":"dzww41afd"},{"id":"xL9JcO9ac7c","name":"Still","artist":"b1J8WG70806"},{"id":"8GjP0Oe93a2","name":"Rainy Day (Vampoleez's Midnight Remix)","artist":"IjN92555"},{"id":"mQXuts7c13f","name":"Cry","artist":"iQ1Ndd69b"},{"id":"JBcUbe2144e","name":"花吹雪","artist":"nngv5660cbe"},{"id":"JAOF7v20545","name":"Blind Faith ","artist":"bh9cc3116"},{"id":"xNd2oT9caa8","name":"Wash Away (Calling For You) [feat.

UK garage is a descendant of house music which originated in Chicago, Detroit, New Jersey and New York. The genre usually features a distinctive syncopated 4/4 percussive rhythm with 'shuffling' hi-hats and beat-skipping kick drums. Garage tracks also commonly feature 'chopped up' and time-shifted or pitch-shifted vocal samples complementing the underlying rhythmic structure. UK garage was largely subsumed into other styles of music and production in the mid-2000s, including dubstep, bassline and grime. The decline of UK garage during the mid-2000s saw the birth of UK funky, which is closely related.(by Wikipedia)","songs":[{"id":"xL0GN8a9d20","name":"F For You","artist":"ndK5f0cb6"},{"id":"crho9fb0e8","name":"The Day I Died ","artist":"Xd0a8ca3"},{"id":"xL4Smed14ab","name":"Hideaway","artist":"bjRDc6ebe"},{"id":"PMrH5d68f","name":"Scandalous","artist":"cEbY349c5"},{"id":"U3hy6795b","name":"Love Me Or Hate Me","artist":"6cv602cf"},{"id":"Mb7O8fb76","name":"Good Luck","artist":"btrV1725b"},{"id":"8IrhVqe4f19","name":"平凡之路（魔音remix）","artist":"ueF379d0"},{"id":"bqwTKGO3951b","name":"On My Mind","artist":"xp176Ad0feb"},{"id":"xN8DcWd993d","name":"II","artist":"UeYnbD27fbe"},{"id":"mQHnal4fe58","name":"I Got The Rhythm (Hip Hop Mix)","artist":"ZLUcada3"},{"id":"UTipd5c00","name":"Better Get That","artist":"bfrXcb7f6"}],"albums":[{"id":"bftsMu92d562","name":"Settle","artist":"ndK5f0cb6"},{"id":"jLcpb58bf","name":"All Night Cinema","artist":"Xd0a8ca3"},{"id":"wVXULA9f247","name":"Sound of a Woman","artist":"bjRDc6ebe"},{"id":"faKD7fbbf","name":"Mis-Teeq","artist":"cEbY349c5"},{"id":"jH4Zaf38b","name":"Public Warning","artist":"6cv602cf"},{"id":"kDck9bfa6","name":"The Face","artist":"ndK5f0cb6"},{"id":"g5jLcbeb7","name":"Latch","artist":"ndK5f0cb6"},{"id":"pa4af3721","name":"White Noise","artist":"ndK5f0cb6"},{"id":"cfTS23749","name":"Kish Kash","artist":"btrV1725b"},{"id":"PRj778eb","name":"Rooty","artist":"btrV1725b"},{"id":"yhEFFEc3e19","name":"贵族生活1.5","artist":"x2VZc9d982d"},{"id":"eX2Y7ca5f","name":"Overtones","artist":"Xd0a8ca3"}],"artists":[{"id":"ndK5f0cb6","name":"Disclosure"},{"id":"mRJ60f8c960","name":"TroyBoi"},{"id":"btrV1725b","name":"Basement Jaxx"},{"id":"Xd0a8ca3","name":"Just Jack"},{"id":"KNE74b0f","name":"Caspa"},{"id":"bB5Xe3f39","name":"Kode9"},{"id":"6cv602cf","name":"Lady Sovereign"},{"id":"6c057680","name":"Wiley"},{"id":"6cu7cac5","name":"Dizzee Rascal"},{"id":"iTsXcd24c","name":"Oily Fish"},{"id":"ZiBd0958","name":"Stanton Warriors"},{"id":"dBuY3c851","name":"Benga"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3362","name":"泡泡糖贝斯 Bubblegum Bass","description":"Bubblegum Bass（有时被称为PC music、bubblebass、post-ringtone、hyper pop 或 bubblegum badass）是起源于20世纪20年代早期的一种电子舞曲。它将流行音乐中的可爱和女性化特征放大到极致。常见的表现形式为可爱有趣的流行音乐与UK Bass、Wonky音乐的融合。\nSOPHIE和A.G.Cook是这个类型中最著名的两个制作人，后者创建的PC Music也成为了Bubblegum Bass最具代表性的音乐厂牌。\n\nBubblegum Bass (sometimes called PC music, bubblebass, post-ringtone, hyper pop or bubblegum badass) is a style of Electronic Dance Music that originated in the early 2010s. It takes Pop music and amplifies its cuteness and femininity to extreme levels, often pitching the vocals upward and warping the rhythm through a frenzied UK Bass and Wonky filter. The production uses bouncy, plastic-sounding synths and further draws from a variety of club sounds, including Electro House, Balearic Beat, Trance, Footwork, and Bubblegum Dance.\n\nSOPHIE and A. G. Cook are the two best known producers in this genre; the latter producer's label PC Music is the label most associated with the genre.

broken beat looks as far back to '70s Jazz-Funk and Dub Reggae while also containing germs from '80s and '90s movements like house, techno, drum'n'bass, and contemporary R&B. Unlike the polite tendencies of acid jazz -- a movement of the '80s and '90s that also blended several styles -- broken beat takes its inspirations as mere launching points and often utilizes frenetic, syncopated beat structures that sound sputtery and stuttered more often than they sound straightforward. Vocalists, predominantly female, feature in many of the tracks, all of which are bold, bright, and -- for the most part -- full of rhythmic tension. Keyboards are another major factor, often taking cues from the likes of George Duke andHerbie Hancock. Immediately after its late-'90s germination, broken beat underwent a fast growth throughout West London. Several labels (2000 Black, Bitasweet, People, Co-Op, Laws of Motion, Main Squeeze) were started by producers -- producers who often worked under several aliases. The fact that the scene was heavily reliant upon collaborations made the style's family tree all the more difficult to diagram. Outposts have since developed in several other countries, including Canada, Japan, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy.","songs":[{"id":"xL1gmYad257","name":"Love Me Again","artist":"mlQGxw4ffd5"},{"id":"xLr1DLbb305","name":"China wave","artist":"K1F73484"},{"id":"bA8R2de78a","name":"Who's Theme","artist":"eyA8350a"},{"id":"xLqismd2d30","name":"Levitation (Ver. 2.0)","artist":"I8w7f2c6"},{"id":"8G1HvKedbba","name":"Hype House (Party Starter)","artist":"bE6atG786fe"},{"id":"gusgb48305","name":"WAMONO～和モノ～","artist":"EZV818af"},{"id":"xLxNDUc9f36","name":"AXION","artist":"x7lUsBa5d9e"},{"id":"xL0F8qa9da6","name":"ELLE Feat.

Disco","description":"迪斯科（英文：Disco)，来自法语的discothèque，意指那些播放录制好的跳舞音乐的舞厅。舞蹈是来源于美国黑人民间舞蹈和爵士舞。近几年在世界，特别是欧洲风靡一时的伴舞音乐，节奏是混合了爵士乐、摇滚乐以及拉丁美洲音乐的某些节奏特点。\n\n与摇滚相比，它的特点是强劲的、不分轻重的、像节拍器一样作响的4/4拍子，歌词和曲调简单。\n\n1977年，因澳大利亚流行音乐小组“比吉斯”（Bee Gees）的电影录音《周末狂热》在美国掀起迪斯科热。迪斯科经常在录音室进行音响合成，制成唱片，但终因节奏单调、风格雷同，于80年代初逐渐被其他节奏不那么显著、速度稍慢的流行舞曲所代替。\n\nDisco marked the dawn of the modern era of dance-based popular music. Growing out of the increasingly groove-oriented sound of early '70s and funk, disco emphasized the beat above anything else, even the singer and the song. Disco was named after discotheques, clubs that played nothing but music for dancing. Most of the discotheques were gay clubs in New York, and the DJs in these clubs specifically picked soul and funk records that had a strong, heavy groove. After being played in the disco, the records began receiving radio play and respectable sales. Soon, record companies and producers were cutting records created specifically for discos. Naturally, these records also had strong pop hooks, so they could have crossover success. Disco albums frequently didn't have many tracks — they had a handful of long songs that kept the beat going. Similarly, the singles were issued on 12-inch records, which allowed for extended remixes. DJs could mix these tracks together, matching the beats on each song since they were marked with how fast they were in terms of beats per minute. In no time, the insistent, pounding disco beat dominated the pop chart, and everyone cut a disco record, from rockers like the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart to pop acts like the Bee Geesand new wave artists like Blondie. There were disco artists that became stars — Donna Summer, Chic, the Village People, and KC & the Sunshine Band were brand names — but the music was primarily a producer's medium, since they created the tracks and wrote the songs. Disco lost momentum as the '70s became the '80s, but it didn't die — it mutated into a variety of different dance-based genres, ranging from dance-pop and hip-hop to house and techno.","songs":[{"id":"U0MQ5fe3f","name":"路灯下的小姑娘","artist":"muiZzz82a8d"},{"id":"8GmED81d70d","name":"Lose Yourself to Dance (Radio Edit)","artist":"dzwH40ebf"},{"id":"xNd5dka6aef","name":"北京女孩","artist":"i1Dfefb1"},{"id":"cjmAneac8b","name":"Miracles","artist":"5c3cfc43"},{"id":"mSrhLK94891","name":"Let Me Cry","artist":"Ymh9f459"},{"id":"xNbN9icf8f2","name":"Bubbling Night","artist":"monS0i5aed5"},{"id":"xN6UqWdc253","name":"我在北京鼓楼蹦迪","artist":"yhDvIO9c87f"},{"id":"8GuRXLe4258","name":"Anibabe","artist":"bnvowk66e23"},{"id":"b4ncFbf343","name":"Turn the Beat Around","artist":"3Vg82755"},{"id":"8GtT07f3187","name":"有你在","artist":"e2Q6ba6c"},{"id":"mSsWfd9652e","name":"Feels","artist":"65N6285b"}],"albums":[{"id":"4Gcd352ec","name":"87狂热","artist":"beNNe007a"},{"id":"nndUxE80c9c","name":"北京女孩","artist":"i1Dfefb1"},{"id":"9cIIeZeeb85","name":"大碗宽面Disco","artist":"yiuoLqb3392"},{"id":"gXBHaU310dd","name":"Lose Yourself to Dance","artist":"dzwH40ebf"},{"id":"mGS3SOb4d42","name":"Japanese Disco Edits","artist":"bnvowk66e23"},{"id":"nofCf526a","name":"Miracles","artist":"5c3cfc43"},{"id":"ycyvlZdfe0d","name":"WuHao Remix","artist":"bRHTf98a87a"},{"id":"yhOZtLdc25e","name":"Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1","artist":"65N6285b"},{"id":"bfMUKhA31939","name":"荷东的士高王中王·CD1","artist":"yhDvIO9c87f"},{"id":"nnlDZt5d9e7","name":"Kokomo","artist":"bad1dabab"},{"id":"b1Cw6u440b4a","name":"Bubbling Night","artist":"monS0i5aed5"},{"id":"yhTUKg23bce","name":"夜店炸场*HOUSE舞曲大串烧 REMIX版 第3期#","artist":"yivOLwac84f"}],"artists":[{"id":"gbhddfe5","name":"新裤子"},{"id":"65N6285b","name":"Calvin Harris"},{"id":"bsE81b374","name":"Bee Gees"},{"id":"2Cm7d7df","name":"ABBA"},{"id":"bpktb5645","name":"Nova Heart"},{"id":"i1Dfefb1","name":"张蔷"},{"id":"yhDvIO9c87f","name":"少女抛尸案"},{"id":"3ce6a825","name":"Earth, Wind & Fire"},{"id":"3dB62f9f","name":"Diana Ross"},{"id":"Tfid67b3","name":"Barry White"},{"id":"2CY73d4a","name":"Blondie"},{"id":"x1m4mE9e661","name":"大波浪"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1825","name":"电子民谣 Folktronica","description":"电子民谣（Folktronica）是将民谣（Folk）和电子乐（Electronica）的结合。通常是将原声乐器，特别是弦乐，通过电子设备进行采样，辅助搭配一些电子乐中的常用节奏（比如嘻哈节奏或者舞曲节奏）模式生成的作品。最先使用这个词的是BurnitBlue.com网站的Jim Byers，用来描述Badly Drawn Boy在作品中的创新，后来Four Tet等音乐人让此风格走向成熟。\n\n特征\n和传统民谣相比，电子民谣的制作过程中会有电脑等数字设备的参与。它是一种折衷的做法，将民谣中的人情味与电子中的科技味进行融合，将两者热和冷的优点互补。\n\n流行时段\n2000年后至今\n\n英文简介 \nor electrofolk is a genre of music comprising various elements of folk music and electronica, often featuring samplings of acoustic instruments—especially stringed instruments—and incorporating hip hop or dance rhythms.Typically, computers are used during the recording process.","songs":[{"id":"OEcR7677d","name":"Suicide Is Painless","artist":"dcky35d5c"},{"id":"b1t5Iaa38c","name":"Green Grass of Tunnel","artist":"btMwe9a83"},{"id":"b0Onbd2be2","name":"Music","artist":"SI1cd921"},{"id":"8GmAR9efc9d","name":"带我往前走","artist":"iUP9d6d88"},{"id":"goydD4847d","name":"Beautiful Boyz","artist":"Wjea7e6f"},{"id":"8GoCosef776","name":"Lonely Press Play","artist":"8vc80b43"},{"id":"mQIBDC55182","name":"Midnight","artist":"6e095c23"},{"id":"8IlqIcf13cb","name":"Alan Walker -

Born in the late '80s, the sound grew out of a fusion between the hard-edged dance music heard on the main floor at raves and larger club events, and the more downtempo music of the nearby chill-out rooms. DJs like Mixmaster Morris and Dr. Alex Patersonblended Chicago house, softer synth-pop/new wave, and ambient/environmental music, prompting a wave of producers inspired by a variety of sources. (Many DJs and producers were also reacting against the increasingly chart-leaning slant of British dance music during those years, exemplified by novelty hits like \"Pump Up the Jam\" by Technotronic and \"Sesame's Treat\" by Smart E's.) Sheffield'sWarp Records proved home to the best in the sound -- in fact, the seminal Warp compilation Artificial Intelligence alone introduced listeners worldwide to a half-dozen of the style's most crucial artists: Aphex Twin, the Orb, Plastikman, Autechre, Black Dog Productions, and B12. Other labels -- Rising High, GPR, R&S, Rephlex, Fat Cat, Astralwerks -- released quality IDM as well, though by the mid-'90s much of the electronica produced for headphone consumption had diverged either toward the path of more experimentation or more beat orientation. With no centered, commercial scene to speak of, North America became a far more hospitable clime to IDM, and by the end of the '90s, dozens of solid labels had opened for business, including Drop Beat, Isophlux,Suction, Schematic, and Cytrax.

Similar to (though largely vocal-less) American hip-hop in its use of sampled drum breaks, typically more experimental, and infused with a high index of ambient-leaning and apparently psychotropic atmospherics (hence \"trip\"), the term quickly caught on to describe everything from Portishead and Tricky, to DJ Shadow and U.N.K.L.E., to Coldcut, Wagon Christ, and Depth Charge -- much to the chagrin of many of these musicians, who saw their music largely as an extension of hip-hop proper, not a gimmicky offshoot. One of the first commercially significant hybrids of dance-based listening music to crossover to a more mainstream audience, trip-hop full-length releases routinely topped indie charts in the U.K. and, in artists such as Shadow, Tricky, Morcheeba, the Sneaker Pimps, and Massive Attack, account for a substantial portion of the first wave of \"electronica\" acts to reach Stateside

of some Dubstep producers reacting against the prevalent trends in that genre. These producers made music which was far closer to the 2-Step and UK Garage of the late 90s and early 00s than that of their contemporaries, deliberately eschewing the heavy wobble bass commonplace in dubstep. The other distinguishing feature of Future Garage is that it is much more accessible for \"home listening\" than UK Garage was - IDM is often a clear influence. The resulting sound is often quite minimalistic, with skittery, broken rhythms and bright, clean melodies. (by Rateyourmusic)\n\nOf the dubstep producers who pioneered this strand of UK garage, the best known is Burial, along with many others on Hyperdub. Futher back in time, there are also clear similarities with the music of MJ Cole and the Broken Beat movement of the early 00s. The term Future Garage was originally coined by Sub.fm's Whistla, who also set up L2S Recordings, the genre's first dedicated label. Other notable artists include FaltyDL, Brackles, Shortstuff, and Joy Orbison.","songs":[{"id":"bCkUhtR4a0d9","name":"河流","artist":"eGEa5b23b"},{"id":"xLEOlqd336d","name":"GIVE U MY TAPE","artist":"UeYnbD27fbe"},{"id":"U594qI26016","name":"Wilhelms Scream","artist":"b95m1b428"},{"id":"xL9Wqsaa679","name":"Loud Places","artist":"eCnQ8286c"},{"id":"mQ8V5T5bb23","name":"Hold On","artist":"c3Vg2a829"},{"id":"mSsacb670de","name":"Midnight","artist":"UeYnbD27fbe"},{"id":"mQPWbH4d31d","name":"WATER","artist":"UeYnbD27fbe"},{"id":"xNh5hIb838e","name":"Stay In My Arms","artist":"ULRSk32861c"},{"id":"mQP7gG7ed1b","name":"Laugh Away","artist":"huDcKe52a6a"},{"id":"xLC6V2e0895","name":"By My Side(By.ZHI16 ,Goldchild）","artist":"htzwBB5141f"},{"id":"8G0PEIfbe05","name":"一月","artist":"CohZ48abb"},{"id":"mQTTns6ef12","name":"眼保健操","artist":"8IE6xme3805"}],"albums":[{"id":"yhEwOca7ed0","name":"Back and Forth EP","artist":"m5HVuB74c05"},{"id":"bvdgbl57495","name":"In Colour","artist":"eCnQ8286c"},{"id":"USfLKY286d0","name":"人间指南","artist":"nn9m2K6a8e1"},{"id":"DDNp48f4e","name":"SBTRKT","artist":"c3Vg2a829"},{"id":"D63n46af3","name":"James Blake","artist":"b95m1b428"},{"id":"bfMGqfY331f3","name":"GIVE U MY TAPE","artist":"bmoVc822f"},{"id":"yhPzhXda82f","name":"LOVE IS ILLUSION","artist":"nn9m2K6a8e1"},{"id":"URVrzK29cf3","name":"Do Hits Vol.3","artist":"mAoRc05368b"},{"id":"moxCaG70e27","name":"Wonder Where We Land","artist":"c3Vg2a829"},{"id":"b1CmuEa43703","name":"一月","artist":"bmoVc822f"},{"id":"beC02v933223","name":"WATER","artist":"UeYnbD27fbe"},{"id":"nnd2CX9655a","name":"Migration","artist":"DBk8d6a9"}],"artists":[{"id":"ecUI723af","name":"The xx"},{"id":"iPcXdc3c8","name":"DOKEDO"},{"id":"bmoVc822f","name":"阿克江Akin"},{"id":"c97x348de","name":"Four Tet"},{"id":"DBk8d6a9","name":"Bonobo"},{"id":"UeYnbD27fbe","name":"VISUDY"},{"id":"c3Vg2a829","name":"SBTRKT"},{"id":"mAoRc05368b","name":"Do Hits"},{"id":"eCnQ8286c","name":"Jamie xx"},{"id":"eD1b88763","name":"Lapalux"},{"id":"nn9m2K6a8e1","name":"Babel Records"},{"id":"ULRSk32861c","name":"化骨龙"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3038","name":"恍惚嘻哈舞曲 Wonky","description":"恍惚嘻哈舞曲（Wonky）是回响重拍（Dubstep）和嘻哈（Hip Hop）（特别是Glitch Hop）的结合，它出现于2000年代中后期。除了这两种元素外，它也受到诸如智能舞曲（IDM）和摇晃科技舞曲（Wonky Techno）的影响。当时一些Hip Hop艺人如J Dilla 和Madlib想尝试一些Dubstep和IDM的元素，而同时一些Dubstep制作人也开始将Hip Hop的节拍融入到自己的作品中，双方契合的想法也让这种风格在2009年开始成熟。\n\n基本特征\n不规则的Hip Hop节奏在Dubstep的速率中行进，有一种恍惚的、不稳定的听感。它也和克他命等药物相关，营造出在迷幻中跳舞的氛围。\n\n英文简介\nWonky is the name given to a fusion of Dubstep and Hip Hop (particularly Glitch Hop) which first developed in the mid-to-late 2000s. Along with those main elements it also has secondary influences such as IDM and its namesake, Wonky Techno. It is defined by its off-kilter and unstable, wonky (hence the name) mid-range, with unquantised and offbeat hip-hop rhythms at dubstep tempos; this sound was at least partially influenced by and is often linked to ketamine use, as it reflects how the drug affects users and their ability to dance.\n \nIt first developed when hip-hop producers influenced by J Dilla and Madlib (such as Flying Lotus and Dabrye) began experimenting with dubstep & IDM elements, and around the same time dubstep producers (notably those on Hyperdub and those associated with the Purple Sound) began adding said hip-hop influences to their own productions.

Regional pockets around the world had emphasized the \"less intelligent\" side of dance music as early as 1994, in reaction to the growing coterie of chin-stroking intellectuals attached to the drum'n'bass and experimental movements. Big beat as a distinct movement finally coalesced in 1995-96 around two British labels: Brighton's Skint and London's Wall of Sound. The former -- home to releases by Fatboy Slim, Bentley Rhythm Ace, and Lo-Fidelity Allstars -- deserves more honors for innovation and quality, though Wall of Sound was founded slightly earlier and released great singles by Propellerheads, Wiseguys, andLes Rythmes Digitales. Big beat soon proved very popular in America as well, and artists attached to City of Angels Records (the Crystal Method, Überzone, Lunatic Calm, Front BC) gained a higher profile thanks to like-minded Brits. Other than Fatboy Slim, the other superstar artists of big beat were the Chemical Brothers and Prodigy, two groups who predated the style (and assisted its birth). Both the Chemical Brothers and Prodigy were never tight fits either, given productions that often reflected the more intelligent edge of trip-hop, and rarely broke into the mindless arena of true big beat.\n\nThe sound of big beat, a rather shameless fusion of old-school party breakbeats with appropriately off-the-wall samples, was reminiscent of house music's sampladelic phase of the late '80s as well as old-school rap and its penchant for silly samples and irresistible breaks. Though the sample programming and overall production was leaps and bounds beyond its predecessors, big beat was nevertheless criticized for dumbing down the electronica wave of the late '90s. Even while recordings by the Chemical Brothers,Prodigy, and Fatboy Slim hit the American charts and earned positive reviews -- granted, from rock critics -- worldwide, many dance fans rejected the style wholesale for being too reliant on gimmicky production values and played-out samples. Big beat lasted a surprisingly long time, given the constraints of a style reliant on the patience of listeners who've heard the same break dozens of times, as well as the patience of DJs to hunt local thrift stores to find interesting samples on old instructional records.","songs":[{"id":"JAN2LX245b5","name":"Swoon (Lindstrøm & Prins Thomas Remix)","artist":"Trjd2110"},{"id":"xL2tYk99144","name":"The One","artist":"iOyua9baa"},{"id":"cOeIU21791","name":"Keep Hope Alive","artist":"bubNeb7ed"},{"id":"mSGAMc5b69c","name":"DJ Chain- Lov3 Ngau Hung(Break Remix)","artist":"nmSz8W6675f"},{"id":"MQTy5bb63","name":"Right Here, Right Now","artist":"Tr3df22d"},{"id":"b2XB1a7a57","name":"Take California","artist":"Ud910a1f"},{"id":"b18xR96b26","name":"Hot Ride","artist":"c9vF2ffa4"},{"id":"gu99o4a95f","name":"Rocket","artist":"bxZn19130"},{"id":"b1TpQ9e22e","name":"Painkiller","artist":"VUDb1944"},{"id":"gseM0497f5","name":"Bass Phenomenon","artist":"d7QD3e67e"},{"id":"MmUB5ff73","name":"Dirge","artist":"UaVd171e"},{"id":"xNbz8Rab98e","name":"邪恶的仙境-1月","artist":"bMgK23ea4"}],"albums":[{"id":"kdF42a869","name":"Another World","artist":"Trjd2110"},{"id":"9cDdP9fc42f","name":"2018 Break Remix","artist":"nmSz8W6675f"},{"id":"bpWi155e6","name":"You've Come a Long Way, Baby","artist":"Tr3df22d"},{"id":"iWQR98b7f","name":"Vegas","artist":"bubNeb7ed"},{"id":"8KgWLK1d1ea","name":"Born in the Echoes","artist":"Trjd2110"},{"id":"bqaN98ebd","name":"Always Outnumbered, Never Outg...","artist":"c9vF2ffa4"},{"id":"bGbFfb235","name":"The Fat of the Land","artist":"c9vF2ffa4"},{"id":"iXoyaee9f","name":"Decksandrumsandrockandroll","artist":"Ud910a1f"},{"id":"PSp96026","name":"Surrender","artist":"Trjd2110"},{"id":"0ZaY316d9","name":"Hanna (Original Motion Picture...","artist":"Trjd2110"},{"id":"kaheab116","name":"Further","artist":"Trjd2110"},{"id":"jmmAe194f","name":"Brotherhood","artist":"Trjd2110"}],"artists":[{"id":"Trjd2110","name":"The Chemical Brothers"},{"id":"c9vF2ffa4","name":"The Prodigy"},{"id":"Tr3df22d","name":"Fatboy Slim"},{"id":"b54pf4441","name":"サカナクション"},{"id":"UaVd171e","name":"Death in Vegas"},{"id":"bubNeb7ed","name":"The Crystal Method"},{"id":"VZGbd936","name":"Tom Holkenborg"},{"id":"bWo71e3e8","name":"Ugress"},{"id":"Ud910a1f","name":"Propellerheads"},{"id":"5T25882d","name":"BOOM BOOM SATELLITES"},{"id":"d2gR3d7a7","name":"Adam Freeland"},{"id":"VUDb1944","name":"Freestylers"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3049","name":"芝加哥浩室舞曲 Chicago House","description":"芝加哥浩室舞曲（Chicage House）应该算是浩室舞曲（House）的原型。它是迪斯科（Disco）退潮后的承接，也是后来各种浩室舞曲分支发展的基础。最早的浩室音乐源自于美国1980年代初期到中期。House一字是出自于芝加哥当代知名的舞厅“仓库”（Warehouse）,当时驻场DJ法兰奇‧那寇斯（Frankie Knuckles）在此播放连续的经典迪斯科可以及欧陆合成器电子音乐的混音舞曲，而舞厅的常客把他的混音作品归纳于浩室类型。 \n\n特征\n芝加哥浩室舞曲代表着浩室舞曲的最基本特征：由鼓机所组成4/4拍子，伴随着厚实的低音声线（bassline）。在这层基础之上再加入各种电子乐器制造出来的声音和取样（sample），比如爵士乐、蓝调或流行电音（synth pop）。\n\n流行时段\n由于芝加哥浩室舞曲的“基础性”，它并没有像后来的某些分支大规模的流行，但它也在从1980年代中至今的任何时段都存在着。\n\n英文简介\nChicago house generally refers to house music which was produced during the mid-1980s and late-1980s within Chicago.

The band began to integrate Acid House into their music in the latter half of the decade, and their influence in the Manchester area gave rise to the Madchester scene in the late '80s. \n\nAlternative dance was also used to describe acts outside of Manchester in the late 1980s and early '90s, including Primal Scream, Jesus Jones, and Saint Etienne.(by Rateyourmusic.com)","songs":[{"id":"cl3Bued674","name":"Don't Worry Be Happy","artist":"X3Saefa2"},{"id":"mQ7NWE92e79","name":"Pumped Up Kicks","artist":"Msm84258"},{"id":"ciRg8f2219","name":"Teardrop","artist":"bfddb9fe1"},{"id":"xLvqQB163f8","name":"Harajuku Girls","artist":"bNi8363e0"},{"id":"xLrWsR121ed","name":"Shooting Stars","artist":"Eoi63fd6"},{"id":"mSFW0x4d0c3","name":"Grandpa","artist":"bCRLjK787d6"},{"id":"UEvu9296a","name":"Latika's Theme","artist":"b0xhe7e5c"},{"id":"JAZ2PK25696","name":"Johnny and Mary","artist":"dIkf3e340"},{"id":"8HNfl3f45fa","name":"Super Far","artist":"JRTch920791"},{"id":"cRnjg201b7","name":"Never Win","artist":"7ee74ad9"},{"id":"xLttjAae002","name":"Iron","artist":"c3go29eec"},{"id":"8G1mWUfdf00","name":"大圣","artist":"8IE6xme3805"}],"albums":[{"id":"eZc49503a","name":"Pretty Donkey Girl","artist":"X3Saefa2"},{"id":"gdd66ba4b","name":"Torches","artist":"Msm84258"},{"id":"bpYjcfed7","name":"Mezzanine","artist":"TrK152fe"},{"id":"4i4B3b653","name":"Love.Angel.Music.Baby.","artist":"bNi8363e0"},{"id":"yhSakKc55ba","name":"Grandpa","artist":"bmoVc822f"},{"id":"kgcnd450d","name":"Bag Raiders","artist":"Eoi63fd6"},{"id":"nU72e4bd1","name":"Slumdog Millionaire (Music fro...","artist":"b0xhe7e5c"},{"id":"zWvB32196","name":"The Sweet Escape","artist":"bNi8363e0"},{"id":"nmT57S7c762","name":"Do Hits Presents Year of Monke...","artist":"mAoRc05368b"},{"id":"ogO1e53fe","name":"Heligoland","artist":"TrK152fe"},{"id":"nndIo05585f","name":"LANY","artist":"JRTch920791"},{"id":"n7gbf3b34","name":"The Mating Game","artist":"ZJac0bec"}],"artists":[{"id":"SDY10585","name":"Blur"},{"id":"cBa230dec","name":"Gorillaz"},{"id":"TrK152fe","name":"Massive Attack"},{"id":"6p293868","name":"The Ting Tings"},{"id":"bw00eb977","name":"Yeah Yeah Yeahs"},{"id":"SJTc1be1","name":"Pet Shop Boys"},{"id":"Msm84258","name":"Foster The People"},{"id":"bNi8363e0","name":"Gwen Stefani"},{"id":"2Iz4d5d0","name":"New Order"},{"id":"bsGufc1f1","name":"Depeche Mode"},{"id":"WM2aa5d0","name":"Kasabian"},{"id":"cC2H2ea5b","name":"Mono"}]},{"type":"style","id":"63","name":"脉冲 Glitch","description":"Glitch字面上是指电脑或硬件设备出的小毛病，它是电子音乐的一种实验手法，主要是用一些数字器械故障所发出的声音作为录音来源，比如仪器爆破声、软件故障扭曲声、CD跳碟声、硬件噪声等等都是Glith音乐人常常喜好的。90年代初，Oval等音乐人尝试用此种声效与氛围乐结合，带动了其发展。\n\n特征\nGlitch不论是从音色还是编曲手法来说都是一种创新，它反映了当前科技时代的无所不能，遵循的是“变废为宝”的理念。广义上被置之不理的音色噪音产生了出其不意的效果。和单纯的噪音音乐天壤之别，Glitch取于噪音但没有躁动，它更阴柔温暖，富于灵性。\n\n流行时段：\n90年代初至今\n\n英文简介\nGlitch is a style of experimental Electronic music that uses the sounds created by malfunctioning digital technology - bugs, crashes, system errors, hardware noise, CD skipping, and digital distortion - as main technique of composition. This unusual method of musical creation arguably began in Germany in the early 90s, with artists like Oval combining the technique with Ambient music to help cement its place in modern electronic music history. At the other end of the Glitch spectrum, Japanese musician Yasunao Tone's use of damaged CDs created dense, extreme walls of sound, with Solo for Wounded CD perhaps being the best example. Modern glitch tends to use software to recreate these sounds, as opposed to genuinely defecting technology, and this increased ease of creation has resulted in the genre spreading out into other areas, such as Glitch Pop and Glitch Hop.

Hardstyle typically consists of a deep, hard-sounding kick drum, intense faded or reversed basslines accompanying the beat, a dissonant synth melody story telling, and detuned and distorted sounds. Many hardcore artists produce hardstyle tracks as well, and many newer Hardstyle tracks are written in compound time (for example, older Headhunterz and Noisecontrollers work).\n\nOrigins：\nHardstyle was influenced by gabber. Hardstyle has its origins in the Netherlands where artists like DJ Zany, Lady Dana, DJ Isaac, DJ Pavo, DJ Luna and The Prophet, who produced hardcore, started experimenting while playing their hardcore records. The first Hardstyle events, like Qlubtempo,took place at the beginning of the 21st century. The first few years of hardstyle were characterized by a tempo of around 140–150 BPM, a compressed kick drum sound, a short vocal sample, a screech and the use of a \"reverse bass\", which can be heard on the offbeat after each kick.\n\nAfter several successful editions of Qlubtempo and Qlimax, Q-dance registered the word hardstyle as their brand on the 4th of July 2002.\n\nAround 2002, more hardstyle labels emerged. Fusion (with artist as DJ Zany and Donkey Rollers) and Scantraxx (founded by Dov Elkabas) are two of the Dutch labels that started to bring out hardstyle tracks around that time.\n\nDubstyle\nIn early 2010, a new variation in hardstyle, named dubstyle was introduced. Dubstyle is the name given to the genre fusion of hardstyle and dubstep. Dubstyle tends to have reversed wobble basslines and take the kick styling of hardstyle tracks, while combining them with the rhythm, groove, and dubstep tempo and effects a fusion of elements of hardstyle with a dubstep rhythm, usually a 2-step or a breakstep rhythm.[8] Because of the sporadic beat in dubstyle, the bass is often more dragged out and/or it doesn't follow a strict offbeat pattern that regular hardstyle incorporates, which in turn results in dubstyle basslines bearing similarities to dubstep basslines.\n\nEuphoric hardstyle\nFrom roughly 2010 onwards, the move towards a more melodic emphasis from early hardstyle evolved into the subgenre \"euphoric hardstyle\", characterized by highly emotional melodies and heavy pitch-shifting of kicks.Notable euphoric hardstyle producers include Coone, Atmozfears, Sephyx, Devin Wild, D-Block & S-te-Fan (DBSTF), Da Tweekaz, Code Black, Headhunterz and Wasted Penguinz.\n\nRaw hardstyle\nSince around 2011, more terms to identify developments of hardstyle were introduced. Raw hardstyle, is a type of hardstyle influenced from Dutch hardcore or older hardstyle resulting in darker melodies, screeches and deeper-sounding kick drums. Notable raw hardstyle artists include Adaro and The Prophet.","songs":[{"id":"8I5e5cf6b22","name":"新X8飞曲","artist":"8yJupp1ccb8"},{"id":"bqv59pK37292","name":"Be Here

Microsound","description":"微声（Microsound）从名字可得知，是将处理对象放在更细微的，即波长周期更短的声音上。微声从字面来看是千分之一秒，但是在实际处理中，其延续时长甚至可达到十分之一秒。Microsound音乐人一般通过数字或模拟处理方式获取这些声音，并通过粒度合成（Granular Synthesis）、蒙太奇拼贴（Micromontage）的方式完成作品的架构。\n\n特征\n总的说来，Microsound和Glitch是属于“近亲”关系，都是将零碎的声音片段作为描绘作品的元素，将细碎之声融合成完整的氛围。但是Microsound因为截取的是更高频段，所以声音颗粒会比Glitch更加细碎，更加简短，更加尖锐。\n\n英文简介\nLargely defined by its own name, the term microsound largely stems from compositions built on sounds lasting no longer than a thousandth of a second, but generally can last up to a tenth of a second. A cousin to the glitch genre, microsound explores the lower and higher frequencies of the sound spectrum through digital and analog signal processing, granular synthesis, and micromontage. It focuses largely on the arrangement of sound particles within a composition.（By Allmusic）","songs":[{"id":"Odsw82bb0","name":"Plumbicon [Live in Osaka]","artist":"VWMba28e"},{"id":"xLqoUNc0334","name":"Odessa","artist":"bw7ie694a"},{"id":"bAWmGd258e","name":"Plastic Star (Session)","artist":"6cC5a804"},{"id":"b04IAb9d25","name":"Chimeras","artist":"6cN68615"},{"id":"UAZA6bb53","name":"U_07","artist":"Wdycaefd"},{"id":"UNQM6de6c","name":"Atavism 02 ","artist":"5XS9ca36"},{"id":"xLp3HCaceec","name":"Test Pattern #0100","artist":"VYDdce42"},{"id":"xNaQmob7f7a","name":"'1' PY","artist":"mXFr0F63834"},{"id":"xLFPuGad159","name":"01 eik","artist":"Hfv53caf"},{"id":"Niiv728bb","name":"Between Heaven and Earth","artist":"Wd8aa84a"},{"id":"xLDmU0e167e","name":"Hang On The Universe［挂在宇宙上］","artist":"J1yCxS20f01"},{"id":"JC7NVl20ec9","name":"For David Robert Jones","artist":"6c67e12e"}],"albums":[{"id":"fKVt7be6f","name":"Swim","artist":"bw7ie694a"},{"id":"iPCCa8872","name":"Plumbicon Versions","artist":"VWMba28e"},{"id":"f7Qt59ed9","name":"Death Of A Typographer","artist":"6cC5a804"},{"id":"nUpGefafa","name":"Vrioon","artist":"Wdycaefd"},{"id":"n1jee853e","name":"Unitxt","artist":"Wdycaefd"},{"id":"f7aj76076","name":"Atavism","artist":"5XS9ca36"},{"id":"9c9343e7e55","name":"PY","artist":"mXFr0F63834"},{"id":"naERe557e","name":"Harmony in Ultraviolet","artist":"6cN68615"},{"id":"fGW393d1a","name":"Test Pattern","artist":"VYDdce42"},{"id":"f7Sc8a0d7","name":"Plastic Star","artist":"6cC5a804"},{"id":"qy7QIO8ec4b","name":"Xerrox, Vol. 4","artist":"Wdycaefd"},{"id":"nmT2Fq837d9","name":"Pixel³","artist":"Hfv53caf"}],"artists":[{"id":"nlLttr61307","name":"BinchOuTan"},{"id":"Wdycaefd","name":"Alva Noto"},{"id":"VWMba28e","name":"Monolake"},{"id":"VYDdce42","name":"Ryoji Ikeda"},{"id":"TrXa4c6b","name":"Pan Sonic"},{"id":"6au7f48c","name":"Frank Bretschneider"},{"id":"6cC5a804","name":"Byetone"},{"id":"5XS9ca36","name":"SND"},{"id":"3KG53b31","name":"Nobukazu Takemura"},{"id":"dSeT443cc","name":"Vladislav Delay"},{"id":"6cQ5d4b3","name":"Jan Jelinek"},{"id":"5Zt69b41","name":"Aube"}]},{"type":"style","id":"61","name":"极简科技舞曲 Minimal Techno","description":"极简科技舞曲（Minimal Techno）是科技舞曲（Techno）下的一个子风格。它是科技舞曲（Techno）的一种极简主义表现方式。随着浩室舞曲（House）和科技舞曲（Techno）的发展，越来越多的音乐人在其之上加入各种层次点缀。极简科技舞曲则是一次向最初简约的回归，并吸收了极简主义音乐的“渐进”美学。90年代初，一些底特律音乐人如Robert Hood和Daniel Bell将其推进。\n\n特征\n极简科技舞曲有两个特征，一个是简明性，它使用直截了当的鼓点和鲜明的合成器程式。除了保留核心结构外，将一切繁杂去除。另一个是渐进性，虽然鼓点和音色看似一成不变，但它们是仍然极为缓慢的向前推进的，从而一点一点的升华情绪。\n\n流行时段\n1990年代初至今\n\n英文简介\nWhen house and techno first came on the scene in the mid-'80s, productions were minimal out of necessity.

It makes reference to the most electronic and minimal forms of New Wave, Coldwave, Synth Pop and Post-Punk. In its most purely electronic and synth driven form is referred as Minimal Synth. It is also named as Synth Wave and Minimal Electronics (instrumental Minimal-Synth).\n\nIn comparison to mainstream Synth-Pop the Minimal Wave sound is sparse, amateurish, stripped down and lo-fi, using analog synthesizers, drum machines and pre-MIDI electronics. The singing is unconventional, with detached/cold vocals. Minimal Wave was mainly developed during the years 1979-85, specially in Belgium, France and Germany. Most bands kept a low profile and a DIY ethic, sometimes releasing self-published cassettes or limited editions by private labels. Since the mid-2000s the interest in the genre has become more widespread, with several reissues and new releases by labels such as Minimal Wave or Anna Logue Records.(By RateYourMusic.com)","songs":[{"id":"xLspFBb5a78","name":"Circles","artist":"K0569c24"},{"id":"mQB6V094e8a","name":"Die World","artist":"nci629f7a"},{"id":"b1qaNiz434ec","name":"Travel","artist":"bzjL8m86c21"},{"id":"L0u9888e6","name":"Ghost Rider","artist":"bsO4f1aa8"},{"id":"bCkJOak493ec","name":"Fall Back","artist":"eCRT7f7f3"},{"id":"mQWNM456875","name":"你谁都理就不理我","artist":"ejspwUe90dd"},{"id":"xL3iMsa3986","name":"Blue Monday","artist":"dIv943371"},{"id":"mQHVUJ5337e","name":"Anyway","artist":"8j1aVGfa5f6"},{"id":"PKJl70e55","name":"Plaza","artist":"XVp12b97"},{"id":"mQBMj873774","name":"Free","artist":"iQFva8743"},{"id":"bf0qZTj2fd14","name":"Deutschland Bleiche Mutter","artist":"bhd69a352"}],"albums":[{"id":"wIm242f2e","name":"The Soft Moon","artist":"K0569c24"},{"id":"mDIrm295d42","name":"Tomb For Two","artist":"nci629f7a"},{"id":"nndGKm67b01","name":"Virgo Rising","artist":"xtOWfh96c8d"},{"id":"gsq07e850","name":"The World Is Getting Colder","artist":"nci629f7a"},{"id":"FeE6bf67","name":"Suicide","artist":"bsO4f1aa8"},{"id":"kD7Bb0bb8","name":"Zeros","artist":"K0569c24"},{"id":"7YRFFVf570b","name":"感受阿杰风格吧","artist":"yi3Li9c484d"},{"id":"dcFCghdf00b","name":"Remembering The Days","artist":"bzjL8m86c21"},{"id":"xI5SOFbdbdc","name":"单枪匹马又何妨","artist":"cgiRa88be15"},{"id":"xTzUj0b5784","name":"Absolute Body Control","artist":"dIv943371"},{"id":"bqHNOb13843d","name":"LINE","artist":"mDMsY8e84eb"},{"id":"bZaKU67e228","name":"Deeper","artist":"K0569c24"}],"artists":[{"id":"bsO4f1aa8","name":"Suicide"},{"id":"nci629f7a","name":"Lebanon Hanover"},{"id":"K0569c24","name":"The Soft Moon"},{"id":"APb9321f","name":"Booka Shade"},{"id":"cEU2tHba71e","name":"Forever Grey"},{"id":"xtOWfh96c8d","name":"Sixth June"},{"id":"Qae77c32","name":"Tropic of Cancer"},{"id":"dIv943371","name":"Absolute Body Control"},{"id":"Ddn7d9cf","name":"Pink Industry"},{"id":"bzjL8m86c21","name":"Days Of Sorrow"},{"id":"eIP9515f4","name":"WHAI"},{"id":"b2qsAyc4264","name":"张抽抽"}]},{"type":"style","id":"57","name":"前卫迷幻舞曲 Progressive Trance","description":"Progressive Trance 前卫迷幻舞曲，「Prog」在这里的意思跟Progressive House的理解是一致的，意为「循序渐进」，前卫迷幻舞曲具有优美的旋律以及不断推进的段落，能够让情绪更加激昂。Progressive Trance去除了重复，循环的旋律段落，而是达到了一种更加亢奋的出神舞曲模式，更加能够感染乐迷，受到了许多乐迷的喜欢。","songs":[{"id":"ck7t6ecf7d","name":"Ecstasy","artist":"Uawc759e"},{"id":"bf0snez328ad","name":"Right Back (Original Mix)","artist":"OVI5353c"},{"id":"8Geie3fcf72","name":"Sun & Moon(Club Mix)","artist":"At554a80"},{"id":"mQPekg6f67d","name":"Premiere Classe (Beat Mix)","artist":"nnbraS9b89b"},{"id":"xL5lLNa280a","name":"Miracle","artist":"9Ii5044f"},{"id":"8Gmj70eddea","name":"Skylarking","artist":"3To4d8bb"},{"id":"mQ6tbr756bb","name":"Poppiholla (5am mix)","artist":"3ZU61b5d"},{"id":"epyma3250a","name":"Psychic Gibbon","artist":"ba85d8eb2"},{"id":"bf28eoL33865","name":"Ocean","artist":"ndQcf96a6"},{"id":"xNDL7Zce0f4","name":"Part of Me (DUB Mix)","artist":"eqKpDUea7da"},{"id":"xN9mnla12e6","name":"震撼舞曲-震耳欲聋","artist":"bqIin8D38a7c"},{"id":"xL414P96b5a","name":"Mirrors","artist":"ISy5e0f9"}],"albums":[{"id":"eKD0915ad","name":"No Silence","artist":"Uawc759e"},{"id":"fLlW541d2","name":"Once Upon A Night","artist":"VTHcb1bf"},{"id":"nmPvMN5d551","name":"Miracle","artist":"9Ii5044f"},{"id":"ga8E751ea","name":"Sun & Moon","artist":"At554a80"},{"id":"b1gowQP3d88d","name":"Milchbar -

The music is heavily influenced by chopped and screwed hip-hop, dark ambient soundscapes, industrial and noise experimentation, and features use of synthesizers, drum machines, obscure samples, droning repetition and heavily altered, ethereal, indiscernible vocals. Witch house visual aesthetic includes occult, witchcraft, shamanism and horror-inspired artworks, collages and photographs as well as significant use of typographic elements such as Unicode symbols.Many works by witch house visual artists incorporate themes from 60s, 70s and 80s cult and obscure horror movies,the television series Twin Peaks,and mainstream pop culture celebrities. Common typographic elements in artist and track names include triangles, crosses, and other Unicode symbols, which are seen by some as a method of keeping the scene underground and harder to search for on the Internet.

A typical 2-step drum pattern features a kick on the first and third beat, with a shuffled rhythm or the use of triplets applied to other elements of the percussion, creating a \"lurching, falter-funk feel\", and resulting in a beat distinctly different from that present in other house or techno. Although tracks with only two kick drum beats to a bar are perceived as being slower than the traditional four-on-the-floor beat, the listener's interest is maintained by the introduction of unusual snare placements and accents in the drum patterns, or scattered rimshots and woodblocks, as well as syncopated basslines and the percussive use of other instruments such as pads and strings.\n\nInstrumentation usually includes keyboards, synthesizers and drum machines. Other instruments added to expand the musical palette include guitar, piano and horns; these additions are almost always sampled.[citation needed] The primarily synth-based basslines used in 2-step are similar to those in the style's progenitors such as UK garage and before that, drum and bass and jungle, but influences from funk and soul can also be heard. Vocals in 2-step garage are usually female, and similar to the style prevalent in house music or contemporary R&B.Some 2-step producers also process and cut up elements of an a cappella vocal and use it as an element of the track. Much like other genres derived from UK garage, MCs are often featured, particularly in a live context, with a vocal style reminiscent of oldschool jungle.\n\nInfluences from hip hop and drum and bass, particularly the hardstep and techstep subgenres have also been noted by critics. The fact that the scene had a significantly different atmosphere to those that surrounded precursors with less aggression at live events was also noted by some critics.","songs":[{"id":"crho9fb0e8","name":"The Day I Died ","artist":"Xd0a8ca3"},{"id":"PMrH5d68f","name":"Scandalous","artist":"cEbY349c5"},{"id":"8IlqIcf13cb","name":"Alan Walker - All Falls Down (DrEuphoria Remix)","artist":"9dflDUf17c8"},{"id":"bCmuNW646983","name":"宋冬野,AirJordy - 斑马斑马（AirJordy Bootleg）","artist":"yhD0EKa9782"},{"id":"Mb7O8fb76","name":"Good Luck","artist":"btrV1725b"},{"id":"mQNVKr8485b","name":"Leaving Beesands","artist":"JNP69039"},{"id":"xLI6NVddcaf","name":"Artak Feat.

Acid house's core electronic squelch sounds were developed around the mid-1980s, particularly by DJs from Chicago who experimented with the Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. Acid house spread to the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes. By the late 1980s, copycat tracks and acid house remixes brought the style into the mainstream, where it had some influence on pop and dance styles.Nicknamed \"the sound of acid\",acid house's influence on dance music is tangible considering the sheer number of electronic music tracks referencing acid house through the use of its sounds, including trance, Goa Trance, psytrance, breakbeat, big beat, techno, trip-hop and house music.(by Wiki)","songs":[{"id":"MMVr712dd","name":"Around the World / Harder Better Faster Stronger (Live)","artist":"dzwH40ebf"},{"id":"P3z6673f4","name":"It's

Since the mid-2010s it has become one of the most popular forms of electronic dance music. It is regarded as a combination of hard dance and electro techno.It has gained mainstream popularity after artists like Hardwell, Nicky Romero and Martin Garrix began infusing it into their musical style.\n\nThe genre is generally 126 to 132 bpm.It is composed of 'lengthy techno-influenced build-ups, a powerful and driving electro-style drop'. It is also known to include a 4/4 hardstyle kick. A typical big room house track features bass-heavy kicks, with minimal musical elements and sometimes only a syncopated supersaw or percussion.It often incorporates drops, minimalist percussion, regular beats, sub-bass layered kicks, simple melodies, and synth-driven distorted breakdowns.","songs":[{"id":"mQOeg17be96","name":"Louder (Extended

Disco","description":"迪斯科（英文：Disco)，来自法语的discothèque，意指那些播放录制好的跳舞音乐的舞厅。舞蹈是来源于美国黑人民间舞蹈和爵士舞。近几年在世界，特别是欧洲风靡一时的伴舞音乐，节奏是混合了爵士乐、摇滚乐以及拉丁美洲音乐的某些节奏特点。\n\n与摇滚相比，它的特点是强劲的、不分轻重的、像节拍器一样作响的4/4拍子，歌词和曲调简单。\n\n1977年，因澳大利亚流行音乐小组“比吉斯”（Bee Gees）的电影录音《周末狂热》在美国掀起迪斯科热。迪斯科经常在录音室进行音响合成，制成唱片，但终因节奏单调、风格雷同，于80年代初逐渐被其他节奏不那么显著、速度稍慢的流行舞曲所代替。\n\nDisco marked the dawn of the modern era of dance-based popular music. Growing out of the increasingly groove-oriented sound of early '70s and funk, disco emphasized the beat above anything else, even the singer and the song. Disco was named after discotheques, clubs that played nothing but music for dancing. Most of the discotheques were gay clubs in New York, and the DJs in these clubs specifically picked soul and funk records that had a strong, heavy groove. After being played in the disco, the records began receiving radio play and respectable sales. Soon, record companies and producers were cutting records created specifically for discos. Naturally, these records also had strong pop hooks, so they could have crossover success. Disco albums frequently didn't have many tracks — they had a handful of long songs that kept the beat going. Similarly, the singles were issued on 12-inch records, which allowed for extended remixes. DJs could mix these tracks together, matching the beats on each song since they were marked with how fast they were in terms of beats per minute. In no time, the insistent, pounding disco beat dominated the pop chart, and everyone cut a disco record, from rockers like the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart to pop acts like the Bee Geesand new wave artists like Blondie. There were disco artists that became stars — Donna Summer, Chic, the Village People, and KC & the Sunshine Band were brand names — but the music was primarily a producer's medium, since they created the tracks and wrote the songs. Disco lost momentum as the '70s became the '80s, but it didn't die — it mutated into a variety of different dance-based genres, ranging from dance-pop and hip-hop to house and techno.","songs":[{"id":"xL0ugUcda63","name":"Get Lucky","artist":"dcn739570"},{"id":"mQ4XqL67740","name":"September","artist":"3ce6a825"},{"id":"LRsJ6b711","name":"I Will

But what seemed to be a brief fad for the public -- no more than two or three hits, including Afrikaa Bambaataa's \"Planet Rock\" and Grandmaster Flash's \"The Message,\" neither of which made the pop Top 40 -- was in fact a fertile testing ground for innovators who later diverged into radically different territory, including Dr. Dre (who worked with the World Class Wreckin' Cru) and techno godfather Juan Atkins (with Cybotron). Electro also provided an intriguing new direction for one of the style's prime influences: Herbie Hancock, whose 1973 Headhunters album proved a large fusion hit, came storming back in 1983 with the electro single \"Rockit.\" Despite its successes (documented in full on Rhino's four-disc Electric Funk set), the style was quickly eclipsed by the mid-'80s rise of hip-hop music built around samples (often from rock records) rather than musical synthesizers. Nevertheless, many techno and dance artists continued harking back to the sound, and a full-fledged electro revival emerged in Detroit and Britain during the mid-'90s.","songs":[{"id":"xLD5ROa9373","name":"把酒倒满","artist":"Fr12a55"},{"id":"cW5qD236dd","name":"Run Away","artist":"70f6702e"},{"id":"mSpSfZ64160","name":"Bang Bang Bang (David Z Remix Radio

Electronic","description":"随着时代的演进，音乐家有了更多制作音乐的方法。所谓电子音乐，就是以电子合成器，音乐软体，电脑等所产生的电子声响来制作音乐。电子音乐范围广泛，生活周遭常常能听到，在电影配乐，广告配乐，甚至某些国语流行歌中都有用到，不过以电子舞曲为最。很多人认为电子乐是一种冷冰冰，没有感情的音乐。其实电子乐也可融入Rock、 Jazz甚至Blues等多种元素而充满情感的。\n\n从广义上来说，电子乐（Electronica）这个词可以指很多的音乐类型，因为电子乐器的使用变的越来越普遍了，而且很多80年代后期的跳舞音乐都是电子的。然而，通常电子乐是指当它刚成形时艺术家们通过电子设备所探索出的各种独一无二的声响，以及后人们所创造出的继承这些先驱们的作品。前卫作曲家们长时间的着迷于利用先进的技术手段，创造那些前所未有的电子声响。法国作曲家Edgard Vare是这个领域的一个先驱，早在上世纪20年代就发明了自己的电子乐设备，50年代一直在实验磁带延时技术。Vare的工作极大的影响了美国前卫艺术家John Cage和德国作曲家Karheinz Stockhausen，后两位极大的扩展了电子乐的曲式结构。然而，直到上世纪70年代，音序器和合成器变得越来越便宜和 简便时，电子乐才真正的进入大众的视野。1968年，Wendy Carlos发行了一张带有迷幻性质的Bach专辑，使用Moog合成器实现了Bach的一些音乐片断。这张专辑在公众中引起了极大的反响，Stockhausen对电子乐器的推广也在德国引起了实验音乐的风潮——Krautrock(德国摇滚)。诸如Can和Neu!等乐队开始将合成器和磁带机的使用带入他们的实验，但是这场风潮中最重要的乐队还是Kraftwerk和Tangerine Dream(橙梦)。\n\nKraftwerk开创了在pop中使用合成器的新观念，他们机器人般的，机械的，催眠性的形式极大的影响了20世纪几乎所有的电子乐。同时，Tangerine Dream受到简约古典作曲技法的启发Kraftwerk乐队，创造了一种称为space的音乐形式，顾名思义，这是一种氛围舒缓的， 曰没惚的音乐。其他重要的艺人还包括Klaus Schulze，他探索了比space还要迷幻的音乐形式；Brain Eno，对于电子元素在pop中的应用有着创造性的发明和实验，可是他最出名还是他的ambient music(氛围音乐)——一种依靠合成器创造出某种环境的音乐类型。\n\nAmbient和space音乐引发了后来的new age(新世纪)，后者强调的是一种安宁的，平和的，深邃的氛围并且旋律及其优美。Progressive electronic(激进电子乐)是new age的一个分支，它表现的是一种更加戏剧化，管弦乐使用更多的形式，从而打破了电子乐根基中的简约风格。此外，诸如synth-pop，techno和 electronica等音乐形式也都在早期的电子乐基础上有了很大的创新。\n\nReaching back to grab the grooves of '70s disco/funk and the gadgets of electronic composition, Electronica soon became a whole new entity in and of itself, spinning off new sounds and subgenres with no end in sight two decades down the pike. Its beginnings came in the post-disco environment of Chicago/New York and Detroit, the cities who spawned house and techno (respectively) during the 1980s. Later that decade, club-goers in Britain latched onto the fusion of mechanical and sensual, and returned the favor to hungry Americans with new styles like jungle/drum'n'bass and trip-hop. Though most all early electronica was danceable, by the beginning of the '90s, producers were also making music for the headphones and chill-out areas as well, resulting in dozens of stylistic fusions like ambient-house, experimental techno, tech-house, electro-techno, etc. Typical for the many styles gathered under the umbrella was a focus on danceable grooves, very loose song structure (if any), and, in many producers, a relentless desire to find a new sound no matter how tepid the results.","songs":[{"id":"b1qqCyz3c4ec","name":"Faded","artist":"xb8rB8a13c9"},{"id":"mQQsBn8e419","name":"Time","artist":"wXtvjVaaae2"},{"id":"mQXZxz7a707","name":"Let Me Love

Dub","description":"Thousands of miles away from sunny Jamaica, a loose collective of Berlin producers jump-started the style of music known as Experimental Dub. If the scene was centered at all, it occurred at Hard Wax Records, a record store as well as a tight distribution company that was home to several of the style's crucial labels (Basic Channel, Chain Reaction, Imbalance) and producers (Maurizio, Mark Ernestus, Porter Ricks, Pole, Monolake). Indebted to Chicago acid house and minimalist Detroit techno figures like Jeff Mills, Rob Hood, and Plastikman, experimental dub was rather easily characterized; the sound usually focused on a mix of crackling, murky atmospheres that sounded almost subaquatic, with a midtempo beat and strong, clanging percussion. The similarities to classic Jamaican dub producers King Tubby and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry were indirect at best, but the term worked well for identifying the signature sound of many of Germany's best experimental producers. Other than the Basic Channel camp, experimental dub's most important figures were Mike Ink (aka Wolfgang Voigt) and Thomas Brinkmann. Ink, a longtime Berlin producer responsible for more than a half-dozen aliases and labels, did most of his important work on the Profan and Studio 1 labels. Brinkmann, a comparative newcomer to the style, earned praise for his remixes of material by Ink and Plastikman. Experimental dub, in turn, inspired several major techno figures (including Plastikman and Mills) by the late '90s, and its influence was even seen in American indie rock and post-rock.","songs":[{"id":"b3XtCbfa21","name":"Free for All [Soundstream Remix]","artist":"5Wk90a43"},{"id":"b1pOnAC65332","name":"Peaks And Troughs (6:59)","artist":"Wdcc5906"},{"id":"8Ghj05f4254","name":"Vantage Isle (CV313 Reduction)","artist":"WaVda8bd"},{"id":"b1eADd89ba","name":"Cups","artist":"VZNbe0c7"},{"id":"mQ8xB052aa7","name":"Adult Goth","artist":"WLBb2ea3"},{"id":"bf0rl2X347c3","name":"Life Has Changed","artist":"bhn7c554a"},{"id":"mQBcsf9149c","name":"Speak To Me,Breath (In The Air) (Dubmatix Remix)","artist":"bih2b837a"},{"id":"ekdyk30fee","name":"Untitled Track","artist":"bLTX23250"},{"id":"mQLiD95216e","name":"极夜之昼","artist":"mDbUnC8fe6e"},{"id":"JARilU35a42","name":"Goodbye Girl (Kuedo Rework)","artist":"bi8td559f"},{"id":"mQFy9S75996","name":"Yup Yup","artist":"g2fCP729368"},{"id":"xLqSaWa78fd","name":"Cherry Blossom Of My Youth","artist":"TRdabea9"}],"albums":[{"id":"8a2F3d4c6","name":"See Mi Yah Remixes","artist":"5Wk90a43"},{"id":"f3Q65b202","name":"Peaks and Troughs","artist":"Wdcc5906"},{"id":"1pWw2eb1c","name":"Vantage Isle Sessions","artist":"WaVda8bd"},{"id":"gbIG61145","name":"Eye Contact","artist":"WLBb2ea3"},{"id":"fOIm886a5","name":"Rhythm & Sound","artist":"5Wk90a43"},{"id":"iPbHe0442","name":"Silencer","artist":"VZNbe0c7"},{"id":"oE89eb985","name":"Dubber Side Of The Moon","artist":"bih2b837a"},{"id":"v07G2b03e","name":"Concept 1 96:VR","artist":"bLTX23250"},{"id":"oecKfff15","name":"Subliminal State","artist":"bhn7c554a"},{"id":"yhTGTC9c224","name":"Vicious Circles","artist":"x7vKqWb8e1d"},{"id":"bRfddW4d071","name":"极夜之昼","artist":"mDbUnC8fe6e"},{"id":"fOku58742","name":"Japanese Dub","artist":"TRdabea9"}],"artists":[{"id":"dAqx3cd9a","name":"Andy Stott"},{"id":"isusKK3b81b","name":"Automat"},{"id":"yjq1bmd68ad","name":"NORA FU"},{"id":"cDi8KDd6242","name":"Self7"},{"id":"m1DPbL8db64","name":"Omiplume"},{"id":"UhquXi28a46","name":"药童时代"},{"id":"nh8Xfec68","name":"周子涵"},{"id":"nuvK5S5d56b","name":"袁正一"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3031","name":"步法舞曲 Footwork","description":"暂无","songs":[],"albums":[{"id":"btTjxwB36e04","name":"Let Me Low It","artist":"9dflnQ1bd43"},{"id":"bFIEjrP4a910","name":"NTS RADIO : Silk Road Sounds f...","artist":"9cythcf870d"},{"id":"bFIGaq148019","name":"Melba","artist":"mcRkGY5d706"}],"artists":[{"id":"bSYQLZ8c7d7","name":"Jlin"},{"id":"x7vKqWb8e1d","name":"Sinjin Hawke"}]},{"type":"style","id":"262","name":"即兴舞曲 Freestyle","description":"暂无","songs":[{"id":"gn0d246011","name":"Because I Love You (The Postman Song)","artist":"cAea2f70e"},{"id":"ejwFh30a57","name":"No One in This World","artist":"3Rl90255"},{"id":"eRUV43bc40","name":"Hang on in There Baby","artist":"4fK796b6"},{"id":"TctR5a69e","name":"Lover on the Line","artist":"CJv5244b"},{"id":"mQPq0B775c1","name":"Sending All My Love","artist":"Bqn8474f"},{"id":"ckftCe7ab1","name":"La Borracha","artist":"UgIa2138"},{"id":"8ITqWzf725b","name":"CHINGSTA","artist":"9dgnkge7fc6"},{"id":"b1J15ca793","name":"No Matter What","artist":"3RJ75395"},{"id":"OjUWb37c3","name":"When I See You","artist":"cAkn2f3da"},{"id":"b1pXCU13ce9f","name":"No Reason To Cry","artist":"cAhU2d864"},{"id":"xL2BF89ef32","name":"Runaway Love (Radio Mix)","artist":"bueje9c06"}],"albums":[{"id":"v7nL27e7c","name":"Love & Emotion","artist":"cAea2f70e"},{"id":"eJuN6550e","name":"Show Me","artist":"3Rl90255"},{"id":"iX9Pdccff","name":"Swing Batta Swing","artist":"4fK796b6"},{"id":"nhCSf28e2","name":"We Can't Go Wrong","artist":"3Rl90255"},{"id":"8hEW40114","name":"Waiting for Your Love","artist":"cAea2f70e"},{"id":"j8uGd50ce","name":"In the Mix","artist":"CJv5244b"},{"id":"j8uHa8299","name":"Around the World","artist":"CJv5244b"},{"id":"jNCd1427b","name":"The Terminator","artist":"cAea2f70e"},{"id":"yhXf4Gbeed0","name":"废壳星人们","artist":"ygfduebbbac"},{"id":"eL0Z5bac4","name":"Flying High","artist":"UgIa2138"},{"id":"iV3Raba92","name":"Funk Boutique","artist":"3Rl90255"},{"id":"iV3Tbe9ab","name":"Satisfy","artist":"3Rl90255"}],"artists":[{"id":"CJv5244b","name":"Bad Boys Blue"},{"id":"3Rl90255","name":"The Cover Girls"},{"id":"dPYE44f24","name":"Exposé"},{"id":"3RD7417b","name":"Information Society"},{"id":"TYN96e9c","name":"Rochelle"},{"id":"d0lZ422f5","name":"All City"},{"id":"cAea2f70e","name":"Stevie B"},{"id":"btUqf872e","name":"Brenda K.

music","description":"“工业”这个词作为一种音乐形式及风格出现并发展于20世纪后半叶，伴随着当时文化思潮而存在。任何一种风格都是受环境影响而诞生的，正应了那句话：“环境铸造人”，什么样的环境决定什么样的艺术家，什么样的艺术家决定什么样的音乐，工业最为典型。\n工业音乐产生于20世纪70年代，于80年代得到长足发展，90年代至今分化融解。当时的欧美人文思潮推崇未来主义、达达主义和超现实主义，又正是信息化与产业化成熟的阶段，更赶上工业化(这里用的是本义)流水线式的生产结构基本成熟，于是工业音乐应运而生。尤其第三点，很形象解释了此种风格诞生的原因和起源，正如“哥特”音乐的本质来源于古典、取材于诞生于欧洲中世纪教会统治时期哥特建筑一样。所以说，音乐的形成是历史文化的体现。\n\nIndustrial music is a style of experimental music that draws on transgressive and provocative themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by the band Throbbing Gristle, and the creation of the slogan \"industrial music for industrial people\". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. Allmusic defines industrial as the \"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\"; \"initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation\". \nThe first industrial artists experimented with noise and aesthetically controversial topics, musically and visually, such as fascism, serial killers and the occult. Their production was not limited to music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms. Prominent industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, SPK, Boyd Rice, Cabaret Voltaire, and Z'EV. The precursors that influenced the development of the genre included acts such as electronic group Kraftwerk, experimental rock acts such as The Velvet Underground and Frank Zappa, psychedelic rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix, and composers such as John Cage. Musicians also cite writers such as William S. Burroughs, and philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche as influences.\nWhile the term was initially self-applied by a small coterie of groups and individuals associated with Industrial Records in the 1970s, it broadened to include artists influenced by the original movement or using an \"industrial\" aesthetic. These artists expanded the genre by pushing it into noisier and more electronic directions. Over time, its influence spread into and blended with styles including ambient and rock, all of which now fall under the post-industrial music label. Electro-industrial music is a primary sub-genre that developed in the 1980s. The two other most notable hybrid genres are industrial rock and industrial metal, which include bands such as Nine Inch Nails and Ministry, both of which released platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. These three genres are often referred to as simply industrial.","songs":[{"id":"8Gm8dUe6cab","name":"Exo","artist":"bsHxf2e2b"},{"id":"U57b9j28cb9","name":"Geboren um zu Leben","artist":"Fdg6d18d"},{"id":"eSDgh5e850","name":"Psychic Colours","artist":"6s45fffe"},{"id":"b3eCuc63c0","name":"Rossiya","artist":"3vZ59025"},{"id":"8G0XkOfd27b","name":"庄心妍 -

The genre is characterised by dark and moody tones. It has a bleak stripped down sound, with raw analog synths, a pulsating drum beat, and cold/detached vocals. This same sort of music without the vocals is also referred to as Minimal Electronics.\n\nMinimal Synth records tend to show a DIY quality, some are pretty experimental when compared to other forms of pop music. The overarching genre of most early '80s synth pop is New Wave, the same applies for minimal synth, the umbrella genre is New Wave in its minimal form: Minimal Wave. The Minimal Synth features explained in this description are often favoured by dark wavers and the avant-garde pop and electronic music fans.\n\nMany Minimal Synth records were released in very limited quantities at the time, so have become collectors’ items and 7\"s can go for several hundred dollars at online auction sites.

These vendors often associate it with re-edits of original-era disco music, as well as with music from European producers who make dance music inspired by original-era American disco, electro and other genres popular in the late ′70s and early ′80s. It is also used by Beatport, to describe the music on several American labels that were previously associated with the genres electroclash and french house.\n\nIn 2002, The Independent described nu-disco as the result of applying \"modern technology and pin-sharp production\" to ′70s disco and funk. In 2008, Beatport described nu-disco as \"everything that springs from the late 1970s and early 1980s (electronic) disco, boogie, cosmic, Balearic and Italo disco continuum,\" while Spin magazine placed an umlaut over the \"u\" in \"nu\", used the term interchangeably with Eurodisco, and cited strong Italo disco as well as electroclash influences.\n\nNu-disco is most popular in Europe and Australia. Bands such as Miami Horror, Cut Copy, Cadillac and Bag Raiders epitomize the Australian nu-disco sound. The French disco-revival sound can be seen in big acts such as Daft Punk, Stardust, Modjo, Madeon, Breakbot, Justice, Chromeo, as well as Duck Sauce, Armand Van Helden's collaborative project with A-Trak. While the latter may qualify more as an electro band, their walking bass lines and funk rhythms (as seen especially in \"I Want Your Soul\") are reminiscent of the genre.","songs":[{"id":"mSqX0W8d5f4","name":"Skyline","artist":"mQOu3u7b1f8"},{"id":"bCmw9RX49f0e","name":"The Man","artist":"TMWade8f"},{"id":"b1sjghf43890","name":"Out Of My Head","artist":"nfi6e8c54"},{"id":"xNmr2jc0550","name":"One Another","artist":"bqyO5aN363fa"},{"id":"xNVQhJ9fdb5","name":"Find","artist":"yiuh4Lcec50"},{"id":"mSsWeI5b8f6","name":"Hard to Say Goodbye","artist":"bic0a6018"},{"id":"b1rD29r3fd2a","name":"Clap Your Hands","artist":"mm7bJy7ccf7"},{"id":"xN0Nvs9a2e4","name":"Bubblegum Angel","artist":"yhDsE4d5b43"},{"id":"xNHZcma1ac5","name":"Stay One Day (Cliff Wedge Special Zyx Remix 2018)","artist":"USDekw2c1b1"},{"id":"8HShyZecfd4","name":"Stumblin In (Original Mix)","artist":"ydfySld7e86"},{"id":"mTk0BW639e3","name":"Venom","artist":"bhsWV8243c"},{"id":"8I4hXDf2d0b","name":"Vacances (Yuksek Remix)","artist":"bfNwQ6m343f7"}],"albums":[{"id":"yhPM18adf70","name":"Night / Daze","artist":"bqyO5aN363fa"},{"id":"JXuUHy39af7","name":"The Man","artist":"TMWade8f"},{"id":"yhT1kXb396f","name":"Out Of My Head","artist":"nfi6e8c54"},{"id":"1ttntWdbf99","name":"Think About It","artist":"nfi6e8c54"},{"id":"yhRYHlb6f13","name":"SAILORWAVE II","artist":"cYpb0Td4ab7"},{"id":"yhVZM4bb085","name":"Find","artist":"nmSwCW9048e"},{"id":"JXuWWP2178e","name":"Mister Mellow","artist":"bic0a6018"},{"id":"nniPtQ8cb24","name":"娃娃","artist":"yivQwNa9d72"},{"id":"nnkXeu82435","name":"Mixmag Presents Peggy Gou","artist":"yiurjHabca4"},{"id":"nnpYBk5e74a","name":"爱的主打歌(陈佰生＆周禹成 REMIX)","artist":"xcpIPWb234a"},{"id":"nnejbM612fe","name":"Clap Your Hands","artist":"mm7bJy7ccf7"},{"id":"yhUAU5d6ee9","name":"江南电音","artist":"yizxa419abd"}],"artists":[{"id":"cPXv3026d","name":"Nicolas Jaar"},{"id":"bfAjah834765","name":"Mura Masa"},{"id":"nfi6e8c54","name":"Satin Jackets"},{"id":"FJIc3e04","name":"Little Boots"},{"id":"dIkf3e340","name":"Todd Terje"},{"id":"burWak6d680","name":"Dabeull"},{"id":"biJya043c","name":"女孩与机器人"},{"id":"bqH0q8m36ed9","name":"Heeze"},{"id":"eaEq42e6842","name":"Ops.7"},{"id":"boHS9e21c","name":"Joe Goddard"},{"id":"nnG2zE85589","name":"稻花枪"},{"id":"yi0BZU9a7fc","name":"Funk Dogg"}]},{"type":"style","id":"401","name":"后迪斯科 Post-Disco","description":"暂无","songs":[{"id":"xLs4ynb397c","name":"A Night To Remember","artist":"btXaec79d"},{"id":"ciX2Lf2996","name":"Forget Me Nots","artist":"cjbL3e326"},{"id":"U59wrg2a2a3","name":"Saturday, Saturday Night","artist":"baeVa574a"},{"id":"8FZvPxfc91e","name":"Rivers of Babylon","artist":"3Uu67b2c"},{"id":"ele5B2f4d2","name":"Call Me","artist":"5cPc7da1"},{"id":"mQ4I9r7e8b6","name":"Take Me To The Top","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"xL2f7M12f24","name":"Close The Door","artist":"3dx15e1e"},{"id":"QNz6594eb","name":"Movin'up","artist":"Z0i9b70c"},{"id":"eRcyv3b893","name":"You're the One for Me","artist":"5c591955"},{"id":"cgDdue8c33","name":"She Works Hard for the Money","artist":"3dQ82315"},{"id":"8Gi1wCe5a62","name":"Lie feat.

Pitchfork writer Martin Clark has suggested that \"well-meaning attempts to loosely define the ground we're covering here are somewhat futile and almost certainly flawed. This is not one genre. However, given the links, interaction, and free-flowing ideas ... you can't dismiss all these acts as unrelated\"Such music often references earlier dubstep productions as well as UK garage, 2-step and other forms of underground electronic dance music.Artists producing music that has been described as post-dubstep have also incorporated elements of ambient music and early 2000s (decade) R&B. The latter in particular is heavily sampled by three artists described as post-dubstep: Mount Kimbie, Fantastic Mr Fox and James Blake.The tempo of music typically characterised as post-dubstep is approximately 130 beats per minute.\nThe production duo Mount Kimbie is often associated with the origination of the term post-dubstep.The commercially popular band The xx's Jamie xx has released remixes which are considered post-dubstep, including We're New Here (2011), a Gil Scott-Heron remix album.","songs":[{"id":"xNVuCv9b1e6","name":"Alan Walker - Darkside(DrEuphoria

Musically, synthwave is often instrumental and has a \"futuristic\" theme, with large, throbbing, retro synths. House influenced heavy drums (often side-chained) are also very popular. It draws inspiration from a variety of genres that originated and/or was most popular during the 1980s, including, but not limited to, Synth Pop, Progressive Electronic, Italo-Disco, Electro-Disco and other derivative styles. Synthwave albums are generally arranged in a style that is similar to a Film Soundtrack, Film Score, Television Music or Video Game Music album. The visual element of synthwave is important as well. Album covers are heavily influenced by 1980s films (especially Science Fiction and Action movies, such as Blade Runner or The Terminator), TV shows (specifically Miami Vice and Knight Rider), video games (notably OutRun and similar titles), and other elements important in 1980s culture. \n\nThe origins of synthwave can be traced back to French Electro House scene in the mid-2000s. Artists such as Kavinsky combined House music with elements of 1980s Electronic music, complete with 1980s inspired artwork. Soon after, several French producers, such as College, Anoraak and Minitel Rose began producing similar styled music. There have also been some synthwave soundtracks, such as Drive and Hotline Miami. \n\nSince then, many record labels have been set up dedicated to this sound (the most important being the French label Valerie, American label Italians Do It Better Records, and the Canadian label Rosso Corsa Records), and a slew of producers have emerged from around the world, as the scene continues to flourish.","songs":[{"id":"JASjvv2386a","name":"Candy Walls","artist":"iPKBd3688"},{"id":"xLzOLqd173c","name":"Recover","artist":"iTrua36b9"},{"id":"xOgHlBa85f2","name":"Dream Trip","artist":"mOlgzO8a266"},{"id":"xNZHZQ150d0","name":"Entre'acte","artist":"yi0TYcbd91c"},{"id":"b1rF5TW6aa9c","name":"Resonance","artist":"8fYARZe7ef3"},{"id":"xNFplTde1ba","name":"Moonshine","artist":"m4eofb67e87"},{"id":"xNhA4Bad292","name":"Gradual Paths","artist":"yiuqqcd6010"},{"id":"mQSJ8s7eab9","name":"Your Sex Is A Dream","artist":"mhvcfE72bb6"},{"id":"xLIPAobaef2","name":"Like Faith Or Some Shit","artist":"eCtM54e1d"},{"id":"xN7iLzcf228","name":"I Recall","artist":"bCoUQ9d44874"},{"id":"JDlxjO21695","name":"When You Grow up, Your Heart Dies","artist":"cZstNJceaf1"}],"albums":[{"id":"bfMTZCL32d2b","name":"Nocturnal","artist":"yhRtRRa706e"},{"id":"9cDR8wfc6b3","name":"Night Drive","artist":"ctNGyiad6da"},{"id":"9czRapf6fc6","name":"Atlas","artist":"nmS4Rp665f9"},{"id":"gjkY92c5d","name":"Era Extrana","artist":"b70sf5851"},{"id":"9czU2wf2314","name":"Endless Summer","artist":"yhRtRRa706e"},{"id":"xP3dWabc83c","name":"Days of Thunder","artist":"yhRtRRa706e"},{"id":"yibsZ2146ff","name":"赛博利亚","artist":"nnFOzZ6743d"},{"id":"1tsjvOc882f","name":"去云端","artist":"nnFOzZ6743d"},{"id":"beCvn3X3121e","name":"Selection 3","artist":"cHJphha18ff"},{"id":"bfNamKC30b14","name":"时间旅行有限公司","artist":"nnFOzZ6743d"},{"id":"nnjuvc5f7ab","name":"Kids","artist":"yhRtRRa706e"},{"id":"88ILBufbbc7","name":"Recover","artist":"iTrua36b9"}],"artists":[{"id":"yhRtRRa706e","name":"The Midnight"},{"id":"eHax954c4","name":"Makeup and Vanity Set"},{"id":"ctNGyiad6da","name":"Timecop1983"},{"id":"cHJphha18ff","name":"Mitch Murder"},{"id":"eCCl7fa84","name":"John Carpenter"},{"id":"yiuoLqb3392","name":"moeNAGI"},{"id":"mnvhkd84d9f","name":"Jaakko Eino Kalevi"},{"id":"nnFOzZ6743d","name":"音速行星"},{"id":"mhvcfE72bb6","name":"Trevor Something"},{"id":"yivUwwc9a5f","name":"CHING"},{"id":"cZstNJceaf1","name":"GUNSHIP"},{"id":"b1CSbsT415ab","name":"HW"}]},{"type":"style","id":"28","name":"部族浩室舞曲 Tribal House","description":"暂无","songs":[{"id":"xNNerxd201f","name":"者活","artist":"cRH82bc5"},{"id":"bBjEnc8d74","name":"Backfire","artist":"b1Cykxe40aa5"},{"id":"f6AEh42a40","name":"The Door [Danny Tenaglia Mix]","artist":"cZYG3bd73"},{"id":"xNhC4cabf63","name":"Ayrılık Zor Orijinal Versiyon","artist":"b4hGef250"},{"id":"xLDwzo9dbf3","name":"Gone (Barbados Mix)","artist":"bob9bf128"},{"id":"U5GUG82bbbf","name":"Sacred Dance","artist":"iT2ccaf48"},{"id":"mQF1NC7a3e9","name":"Te Quiero [Atfc Remix]","artist":"Yzjb6027"},{"id":"ekT4Y2fc3d","name":"Future!","artist":"3TQc3de8"},{"id":"xNLNZ51d848","name":"The Pestle","artist":"YSI13030"},{"id":"xNhUSddbe5a","name":"Blah Blah Blah","artist":"Z5I9e093"},{"id":"xLpHmG98b50","name":"User 08 Track A1","artist":"b7Wde45e1"},{"id":"mSSzGF9cbeb","name":"Schiave Bianche","artist":"yivLPBc74c8"}],"albums":[{"id":"nnjYgv8531e","name":"ZenPumper","artist":"nmSrgR6d695"},{"id":"jLcLc1fe5","name":"Toronto 09","artist":"b4aqec120"},{"id":"b1C1ZnT3c6a5","name":"Spirits From Tuva","artist":"VDd9a205"},{"id":"f3ixbe033","name":"On the Road, Vol. 3","artist":"ea7i47c27"},{"id":"iVNHdce72","name":"E=VC2, Vol. 2","artist":"cZYG3bd73"},{"id":"yhP01Ebae31","name":"Ayrılık Zor","artist":"b4hGef250"},{"id":"bBah7a907ba","name":"Acqua","artist":"iT2ccaf48"},{"id":"bfNdK4D30564","name":"DJ Doggy 音药疫苗 Mix","artist":"LNT90f1d"},{"id":"bxKbqu95a41","name":"Heavyweight Gringos","artist":"Yzjb6027"},{"id":"9cJQRue9e45","name":"DJ Doggy Live Mix 2019-08-09","artist":"LNT90f1d"},{"id":"yiaSkr13c40","name":"DJ Doggy Live Mix 2019-12-20.m...","artist":"LNT90f1d"},{"id":"9cFIVEe4599","name":"The Pestle","artist":"YSI13030"}],"artists":[{"id":"VTLd97e4","name":"Eat Static"},{"id":"bKgi239d6","name":"Transglobal Underground"},{"id":"b7Wde45e1","name":"Misstress Barbara"},{"id":"ea7i47c27","name":"Monika Kruse"},{"id":"TT4a6546","name":"Ultra Naté"},{"id":"AL051060","name":"DJ Gregory"},{"id":"5U258798","name":"Dubtribe Sound System"},{"id":"cZYG3bd73","name":"Victor Calderone"},{"id":"TUfc7a3b","name":"Frankie Bones"},{"id":"5WH832d2","name":"Exquisite Corpse"},{"id":"nnJmt14db44","name":"Masher"},{"id":"VVxa6a7a","name":"George X"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3037","name":"英国贝斯舞曲 UK Bass","description":"Also known as:  UK Bass Music, Future Bass\nUK Bass is a loose term used for certain stylistic developments in British dance music, arising from Dubstep and UK Funky in 2009 and 2010.

R&B kept the tempo and the drive of jump blues, but its instrumentation was sparer and the emphasis was on the song, not improvisation. It was blues chord changes played with an insistent backbeat. During the '50s, R&B was dominated by vocalists like Ray Charles and Ruth Brown, as well as vocal groups like the Drifters and the Coasters. Eventually, R&B metamorphosed into soul, which was funkier and looser than the pile-driving rhythms of R&B. Soul came to describe a number of R&B-based music styles. From the bouncy, catchy acts at Motown to the horn-driven, gritty soul of Stax/Volt, there was an immense amount of diversity within soul. During the first part of the '60s, soul music remained close to its R&B roots. However, musicians pushed the music in different directions; usually, different regions of America produced different kinds of soul. In urban centers like New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, the music concentrated on vocal interplay and smooth productions. In Detroit, Motown concentrated on creating a pop-oriented sound that was informed equally by gospel, R&B, and rock & roll. In the South, the music became harder and tougher, relying on syncopated rhythms, raw vocals, and blaring horns.

R&B kept the tempo and the drive of jump blues, but its instrumentation was sparer and the emphasis was on the song, not improvisation. It was blues chord changes played with an insistent backbeat. During the '50s, R&B was dominated by vocalists like Ray Charles and Ruth Brown, as well as vocal groups like the Drifters and the Coasters. Eventually, R&B metamorphosed into soul, which was funkier and looser than the pile-driving rhythms of R&B. Soul came to describe a number of R&B-based music styles. From the bouncy, catchy acts at Motown to the horn-driven, gritty soul of Stax/Volt, there was an immense amount of diversity within soul. During the first part of the '60s, soul music remained close to its R&B roots. However, musicians pushed the music in different directions; usually, different regions of America produced different kinds of soul. In urban centers like New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, the music concentrated on vocal interplay and smooth productions. In Detroit, Motown concentrated on creating a pop-oriented sound that was informed equally by gospel, R&B, and rock & roll. In the South, the music became harder and tougher, relying on syncopated rhythms, raw vocals, and blaring horns. All of these styles formed soul, which ruled the black music charts throughout the '60s and also frequently crossed over into the pop charts. During the '60s and '70s, soul began to splinter apart -- artists like James Brown and Sly Stone developed funk; Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff initiated Philly soul with the O'Jays and Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes; and later in the decade, danceable R&B became a mass phenomenon with the brief disco fad.

The genre is characterized by a strong groove, usually carried out by bass guitar or drumkits, a prominent use of extended chords, and a percussive guitar style using a wah pedal. Funk usually focuses less on melody and more on the danceable rhythm and groove. \n\nOne of the founders of funk was James Brown, who implemented a signature groovy sound by emphasizing the downbeat and singing in a distinctly emphatic voice. Other seminal acts in funk include Sly & The Family Stone, Funkadelic and Parliament (both headed by George Clinton who created the P-Funk sound), and The Meters. \n\nFunk has also been fused with numerous genres, such as jazz (for Jazz-Funk), Latin-associated genres (for Latin Funk), and Rock (for Funk Rock). \n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, funk expanded even further, incorporating elements from Disco, Electro, and Hip Hop. During this time Prince and Rick James along with others were vital in the development of Synth Funk. \n\nFunk also advanced in countries outside of the United States of America. In West Africa, a particular blend of Vodoun and funk arose, resulting in what many call Afro-Funk. The most important artist of this style was T.P. Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou. In Nigeria, Fela Kuti melded Highlife, Yoruba music, and funk to create what is known as Afrobeat. India, Ethiopia, and some European countries all had a hand in the development of distinct funk styles that broke away from the American norms.(by Rateyourmusic)","songs":[{"id":"xLJI0kb5a5a","name":"Don't Wanna Know","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"mQ4XqL67740","name":"September","artist":"3ce6a825"},{"id":"chcAqfae44","name":"Superstition","artist":"btgkff04f"},{"id":"8GhgNue9582","name":"Warm my soul (with Courtney John)","artist":"KTw6b859"},{"id":"b9Lkbbf687","name":"I Got You (I Feel Good)","artist":"Tcwa1d1d"},{"id":"8ISHE01d6a2","name":"情深深雨濛濛","artist":"bC7KIFs43e80"},{"id":"b4NXNd2095","name":"The Value of Life ","artist":"bjIc100b7"},{"id":"Npnm7c3d7","name":"Bruce Lee","artist":"4KY75bc5"},{"id":"OwS0db71e","name":"Play That Funky Music","artist":"TWu9d15a"},{"id":"glFD746c30","name":"Rock With You","artist":"3c862f8e"},{"id":"ePawc38871","name":"Can't Stop","artist":"c8Om32b23"},{"id":"b0Urxca0d8","name":"Word Up!","artist":"3b892384"}],"albums":[{"id":"fJsn84c22","name":"Dance Trax","artist":"3ce6a825"},{"id":"xg1OEma5d5d","name":"Get Lucky","artist":"dzwH40ebf"},{"id":"f1Bh5c9a9","name":"20 All-Time Greatest Hits!","artist":"Tcwa1d1d"},{"id":"bmrab8484","name":"Talking Book","artist":"btgkff04f"},{"id":"dXo4ecf9722","name":"Tuxedo","artist":"nhkrnn5de42"},{"id":"nqV5fd6df","name":"Silver Rain","artist":"4KY75bc5"},{"id":"cghkLI522ff","name":"Rocking & Rockers","artist":"yhbMYid7cfd"},{"id":"bBRmffc49","name":"Off the Wall","artist":"3c862f8e"},{"id":"gqUH8ebac","name":"Warm my Soul","artist":"KTw6b859"},{"id":"c6PMtx14466","name":"Soul Beats Bboy Vol.5","artist":"yhbMYid7cfd"},{"id":"ekatQf1dd5c","name":"Soul Beats Bboy Vol.3","artist":"yhbMYid7cfd"},{"id":"beHMe0644","name":"By the Way","artist":"c8Om32b23"}],"artists":[{"id":"3c862f8e","name":"Michael Jackson"},{"id":"mQOu3u7b1f8","name":"FKJ"},{"id":"b6T2f8612","name":"宇宙人"},{"id":"btgkff04f","name":"Stevie Wonder"},{"id":"Tcwa1d1d","name":"James Brown"},{"id":"2Jtd15c4","name":"Prince"},{"id":"c9gQ2eb3e","name":"Marvin Gaye"},{"id":"yiufBva91b7","name":"9m88"},{"id":"3ce6a825","name":"Earth, Wind & Fire"},{"id":"Tfaa9743","name":"Luther Vandross"},{"id":"4KY75bc5","name":"Marcus Miller"},{"id":"bnvowk66e23","name":"YUNG BAE"}]},{"type":"style","id":"404","name":"灵魂乐 Soul","description":"灵魂乐（Soul Music），是1950年代发源自美国，它结合了黑人福音音乐（Gospel Music）、节奏蓝调（R&B）和爵士（Jazz）等音乐流派。灵魂乐通过节奏蓝调的加入让传统福音音乐其更加世俗化。它有鲜明的节奏、拍掌、即兴肢体动作。此外，独唱与伴唱之间的对唱、紧绷的发声技巧I也是其主要特色。早期灵魂乐的代表作是雷·查尔斯演唱的《I Got a Woman》。\n\n整个60年代后期，灵魂乐开始颓废，像Rascals,the Box Tops,Mitch Ryder,Tony Joe White和Roy Head乐队受到一系列的重创。\n\n70年代时，灵魂乐继续发展，如霍尔与奥兹、Robert Palmer、Average White Band、Boz Scaggs，和大卫·鲍伊等乐队的推进，使演奏风格更加现代化。\n\n灵魂乐影响了摇滚乐的产生和发展，而后来不同形式的新时代元素的加入也带给灵魂乐各式各样新的音乐表现和内涵。\n\nSoul music is a popular music genre that originated in the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s.

In the '70s, pop-soul became slicker, and it eventually metamorphosed into disco.","songs":[{"id":"xLsv9rc2e40","name":"Someone Like You (Live Acoustic)","artist":"dSoV491e5"},{"id":"8GpHgvf7796","name":"Stay With Me","artist":"cOcF1dd24e9"},{"id":"mQGvd889c00","name":"Take Me To Church","artist":"yfWNMrdc983"},{"id":"U5KlNH2c0d4","name":"Happy","artist":"dcn739570"},{"id":"JAWeWX22b3b","name":"Blurred Lines","artist":"4Zq8f620"},{"id":"b1qbmcc3f764","name":"썸","artist":"gqn4uq2ba97"},{"id":"TJ3Q6e60e","name":"Mercy ","artist":"bt3O27bcd"},{"id":"mQ5I3H73a8f","name":"I'm in Here","artist":"cKig2d251"},{"id":"mQBPzS55d6f","name":"Twinkle","artist":"cCVnPUd6a0b"},{"id":"xL8mYrcec5e","name":"나는 달라","artist":"de8q7wcc2a6"},{"id":"mQPQ3q8cf20","name":"꺼내 먹어요","artist":"cTvV312b8"},{"id":"xL3weDcee5a","name":"旅行中忘记","artist":"OUz8a783"}],"albums":[{"id":"rQ3W24008","name":"21","artist":"dSoV491e5"},{"id":"b5ZCve73112","name":"In The Lonely Hour","artist":"cOcF1dd24e9"},{"id":"8rfD40b7a","name":"19","artist":"dSoV491e5"},{"id":"bYo5yf6c246","name":"Hozier","artist":"yfWNMrdc983"},{"id":"k6R9a4523","name":"TWINKLE","artist":"cCVnPUd6a0b"},{"id":"eY7M6beb8","name":"Rockferry","artist":"bt3O27bcd"},{"id":"nmy4Uu81da5","name":"G I R L","artist":"dcn739570"},{"id":"nmTt8q9f220","name":"25","artist":"dSoV491e5"},{"id":"hyp7pL2e7db","name":"Blurred Lines","artist":"Wlace6ba"},{"id":"fYkf79319","name":"Rolling In the Deep","artist":"dSoV491e5"},{"id":"UDO8RJ29057","name":"썸","artist":"gqn4uq2ba97"},{"id":"9kv241d15","name":"We Are Born","artist":"cKig2d251"}],"artists":[{"id":"dSoV491e5","name":"Adele"},{"id":"lbPox5b329","name":"Amy Winehouse"},{"id":"cOcF1dd24e9","name":"Sam Smith"},{"id":"h3AU35e5a3","name":"iKON"},{"id":"btd11cbc4","name":"Ray Charles"},{"id":"5jS64c8d","name":"John Legend"},{"id":"bt3O27bcd","name":"Duffy"},{"id":"iTDHc7000","name":"李遐怡"},{"id":"3dE6d836","name":"Sade"},{"id":"dcn739570","name":"Pharrell Williams"},{"id":"btgkff04f","name":"Stevie Wonder"},{"id":"b6Fle9f29","name":"常石磊"}]},{"type":"style","id":"431","name":"新灵魂乐 Neo-Soul","description":"1997年，Motown唱片公司为歌手伊莲卡巴度（Erykah Badu）发行了她的第一张专辑《巴度主义》（Baduizm），而Motown唱片的老板卡德尔马森博格（Kedar Massenburg）相当喜欢这张专辑的风格并且为它取名新灵魂乐，这就是新灵魂乐名字的由来。新灵魂乐（Neo-Soul又称为Nu-Soul）是一种多元化的音乐类型，它是由当代R&B（Contemporary R&B），hip-hop和传统灵魂乐（Soul）结合而成的。作为R&B的一种，新灵魂乐拥有传统灵魂乐必备的优异唱腔，配合上现代化编曲，使得它更容易被现代乐迷接受。但是它却又深深的受到了爵士乐（Jazz）和诗歌文法的影响，这让新灵魂乐又赢得了不少非主流乐迷的喜爱。其实现在各种音乐类型之间的界线已经相当模糊了，而新灵魂乐这样的混合产物更是如此。但是所有的新灵魂乐歌曲都有一个特点，就是歌手歌颂世间万物的美丽并且宣扬灵与爱。所以可以说新灵魂乐是最能触动人心灵的音乐之一了。\n\nThough it's roughly analagous to contemporary R&B, Neo-Soul artists pay more devotion to the era of classic soul, often seeking a sound and a style of songwriting with few concessions to events in the music world post-1975. The work of Lauryn Hill, first in the Fugees and later with her 1998 solo debut The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, proved very important to the neo-soul scene, as did the debut of Erykah Badu in 1997. Several more females made splashy debuts around the turn of the millennium, including Macy Gray, Jill Scott, India.Arie, and Alicia Keys, but only the latter broke through to broad stardom. Other figures pursuing the neo-soul sound include Raphael Saadiq, Remy Shand, Sunshine Anderson, Musiq, Peven Everett, and Jaguar Wright.","songs":[{"id":"xL1z2Baf101","name":"All Of

Chicago vocal groups tended to feature laid-back sweet harmonies, while solo artists exhibited a highly melodic and somewhat pop approach to their songs.\n\nAccompaniment usually featured highly orchestrated arrangements, with horns and strings, by such notable arrangers as Johnny Pate (who largely worked with horns) and Riley Hampton (who specialized in strings). This kind of soul music is sometimes called “soft soul”, to distinguish it from the more harsh and gospelly “hard soul” style.","songs":[{"id":"Ou7w82585","name":"Lovin' You","artist":"5iO644ca"},{"id":"cieP11a7ce","name":"Superfly","artist":"TdUe08e7"},{"id":"Oovi56ffa","name":"You Goin' Miss Your Candyman","artist":"Vkhdd43c"},{"id":"b0ZEgc5eea","name":"Have You Seen Her?","artist":"Tc9c3159"},{"id":"cjltDfffc0","name":"The Ghetto","artist":"Ve2c6e0b"},{"id":"OkbW9489b","name":"So in Love With You","artist":"5jA7f91b"},{"id":"xLrpzAab326","name":"Hard Times","artist":"dGscaa859"},{"id":"xLy1Kcab6ad","name":"Powerful Love","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"b2sqHab814","name":"Let Her Go","artist":"cBmw33502"},{"id":"eP4kA36ae9","name":"For All We Know","artist":"Tdfaba68"},{"id":"b2tUvc3620","name":"With These Hands","artist":"d1nW413fc"},{"id":"mQJIY863711","name":"Rescue Me","artist":"bveMffbd5"}],"albums":[{"id":"nnbufba21","name":"Perfect Angel","artist":"5iO644ca"},{"id":"blVB9b9fe","name":"Superfly","artist":"TdUe08e7"},{"id":"jaO3a7555","name":"What Color Is Love","artist":"Vkhdd43c"},{"id":"blAQbf30d","name":"(For God's Sake) Give More Pow...","artist":"Tc9c3159"},{"id":"8lK63e3fa","name":"Adventures in Paradise","artist":"5iO644ca"},{"id":"jaLMcc4da","name":"Love Oh Love","artist":"5jA7f91b"},{"id":"kh1Bd834a","name":"Free Soul","artist":"Ve2c6e0b"},{"id":"nnWkfce8e","name":"Everything Is Everything","artist":"Ve2c6e0b"},{"id":"LUE68c41","name":"Curtis","artist":"TdUe08e7"},{"id":"nmX4e7c34","name":"Occasional Rain","artist":"Vkhdd43c"},{"id":"bJmFgp8ffde","name":"Petals: The Minnie Riperton Co...","artist":"5iO644ca"},{"id":"blARaac4f","name":"A   Lonely Man","artist":"Tc9c3159"}],"artists":[{"id":"TdUe08e7","name":"Curtis Mayfield"},{"id":"5iO644ca","name":"Minnie Riperton"},{"id":"Vkhdd43c","name":"Terry Callier"},{"id":"Ve2c6e0b","name":"Donny Hathaway"},{"id":"Tc9c3159","name":"The Chi-Lites"},{"id":"3etb2550","name":"Jackie Wilson"},{"id":"5jA7f91b","name":"Leroy Hutson"},{"id":"TcP9e68f","name":"Tyrone Davis"},{"id":"cBmw33502","name":"Syl Johnson"},{"id":"beknb34f3","name":"Johnny Pate"},{"id":"clmR27929","name":"Carl Davis"},{"id":"xpC2zpaacd8","name":"K3NT"}]},{"type":"style","id":"418","name":"乡村灵魂乐 Country Soul","description":"乡村灵魂乐（Country Soul）是灵魂乐（Soul）的子风格，它是乡村乐（Country）和灵魂乐（Soul）的结合。在1950年代末、1960年代初，白人的Country和黑人的Soul都有很大的发展，而福音元素在两者之间均有体现，也因为这个机缘，一些音乐人尝试将Country的音乐特色及其福音元素融入到自己的Soul中，这样才让Country Soul得以发展。\n\n基本特征\n尽管Country是白人主导的风格，但是Country Soul的大部分代表艺人是黑人。但是Country的元素在其中很明显，比如Country特有的清脆钢琴声、悠扬的布鲁斯吉他音色，以及对人生及爱情更复杂、更宿命论的歌词描述等等。另外福音的元素也不可少，Country和Soul分别特有的福音和声以及教堂中使用的风琴元素也都是其所常见的。\n\n流行时段\n1960年代-1970年代\n\n英文简介\n\n\"Country Soul\" resulted from the shared genealogy of gospel in both soul and country music; although white gospel and black gospel styles began life with major stylistic differences, they had merged somewhat by the 1950s, and, added to that fact, whites were by then hearing recorded black gospel at a much greater frequency than ever before. The result, oddly enough, worked to the reverse of then-current musical trends: country-soul was in actuality the triumph of country gospel traditions seeping into soul music. Although there were some white proponents of the new sound (Joe South, Charlie Rich), the typical \"country soul\" song was done by a black soul artist, usually with tinkling country piano, gospel harmonies of either tradition, and lead guitar lines that sounded high and twangy like country while playing what was essentially blues. Country-soul songs were also often grounded in stately church organ and likely to, as with country music, deal with more complex and fatalistic depictions of romantic relationships in their lyrics.\n\nThe new genre arose primarily in the South, where strong religious beliefs made gospel highly influential to both blacks and whites, and where musical miscegenation was, ironically, more likely to take place than in other areas of America. Although artists like Albert Alexander and Solomon Burke had already begun tentatively exploring this style by 1960, Ray Charles' landmark 1962 album Modern Sounds In Country And Western is often considered the commercial breakthrough of the genre. The style lasted well into the early Seventies, with several spinoff genres like the more gospel-heavy and emotional \"Deep Soul,\" the grittier, bluesier \"Southern Soul,\" and the later, funkier variant known as \"Swamp Rock.\" Eventually, like most soul variants, it was killed off by disco and subsequent dance movements.(by about.com)","songs":[{"id":"KZ5s925ea","name":"I Can't Stop Loving You","artist":"btd11cbc4"},{"id":"mQ42ii52c58","name":"Thank You for the Love","artist":"H665bca4"},{"id":"b0SN9b8709","name":"After All These Years","artist":"Tczca0f0"},{"id":"bAAkfa0a1e","name":"I Really Love You  ","artist":"Fan683a5"},{"id":"KXM895d05","name":"The Dark End of the Street","artist":"Tc4d2840"},{"id":"mQ6HyL6e777","name":"You Are Not Alone","artist":"bvjxf30f8"},{"id":"ekmPM32385","name":"Little Green Apples","artist":"5h7699e3"},{"id":"xLJ8BSae64b","name":"Five Hundred Miles","artist":"5iU7fb30"},{"id":"xLsrQbd23d7","name":"Hurt","artist":"dQ0A48585"},{"id":"mQPxUP92b87","name":"Can Your Monkey Do The Dog","artist":"bto0179ec"},{"id":"b394Ydab7f","name":"Long Time Gone","artist":"bum21c19b"},{"id":"b0Cvkb1042","name":"Come Softly to Me","artist":"btf8e6a0d"}],"albums":[{"id":"L8857059","name":"Modern Sounds in Country and W...","artist":"btd11cbc4"},{"id":"jIp8c88fd","name":"The Truth According to Ruthie ...","artist":"Fan683a5"},{"id":"L6p7cbb6","name":"Make Do With What You Got","artist":"Tczca0f0"},{"id":"dF31cLeecfc","name":"Here We Go Again","artist":"btd11cbc4"},{"id":"oeYRf4ab3","name":"Midnight Pumpkin","artist":"H665bca4"},{"id":"L79eb68f","name":"You Got My Mind Messed Up","artist":"Tc4d2840"},{"id":"f6HF83292","name":"Ray Sings Basie Swings","artist":"btd11cbc4"},{"id":"blAcb36f5","name":"Friendship","artist":"btd11cbc4"},{"id":"CxSr49b3c","name":"Simon Country","artist":"5iU7fb30"},{"id":"bTjx9t82890","name":"Genius & Soul: The 50th Annive...","artist":"btd11cbc4"},{"id":"gqtg8d3eb","name":"The Very Best of Ray Charles [...","artist":"btd11cbc4"},{"id":"keGTbea01","name":"You Are Not Alone","artist":"bvjxf30f8"}],"artists":[{"id":"btd11cbc4","name":"Ray Charles"},{"id":"Teh21c6a","name":"Aaron Neville"},{"id":"Tczca0f0","name":"Solomon Burke"},{"id":"btf8e6a0d","name":"Percy Sledge"},{"id":"Fan683a5","name":"Ruthie Foster"},{"id":"bvjxf30f8","name":"Mavis Staples"},{"id":"Vi2dcd34","name":"The Staple Singers"},{"id":"dQ0A48585","name":"Timi Yuro"},{"id":"Tc4d2840","name":"James Carr"},{"id":"dbnb35580","name":"Candi Staton"},{"id":"btdae3834","name":"Arthur Alexander"},{"id":"5iU7fb30","name":"Joe Simon"}]},{"type":"style","id":"433","name":"深度放克 Deep Funk","description":"深度放克是一种朦胧地录制方克乐曲的形式。基本上也只有狂热的收藏家和乐迷们会对它感兴趣。就好像南方灵魂乐(也叫深度灵魂乐)，深度方克可以唤起方克音乐中那种强烈的，只属于美国黑人文化的韵味。它同时也给人感觉像是仅仅属于唱片收藏家的压箱宝底。它可以是清唱或者纯乐器演奏，但其精髓在于韵律、抑扬和音符本身，而不是写歌的过程。深度方克鲜于做形式上的革新，而基本上只从像James Brown或者the Meters这样的方克乐大师中才能体现其价值；或是根据作曲家们对于音乐认知度的差异，进入更加爵士味，更加即兴的领域。一些深度方克的歌曲曾经在大唱片公司的发碟中出现过，但被混搭并埋没在其它曲风中了。它们中的另一些歌曲则在发行量可怜的独立唱片制作中被筛选出了局。但不管是哪种情况，深度方克代表的是方克乐的根基。就好像是六十年代的那些美国地下乐队在车库里狂热地录制他们所喜爱的英伦或者迷幻乐。它们中的一些是神作，一些算是好歌，当然也有使人过耳即忘的。美国人对于深度方克的旧情复燃是跟说嘻哈的兴起息息相关的。由于当时的人们贪婪地寻找那些可以用来录制深度方克的新鲜或者稀有的“母版”歌曲，甚至是那种英国北部的灵魂乐俱乐部内所特有的味道，都被挖掘出来了。受益于这种“淘金运动”，美国人在不经意间发现了一些珍贵的乡村爵士乐和偏甜的灵魂乐中具有代表性的老碟。当这种运动达到变态的巅峰时，深度方克的收藏家们甚至都已经不在乎藏品的真实价值了，而只看重绝版或者发行量的稀少，从而享受于涉猎此种唱片的过程。这其实挺容易办到的，因为世人甚至连他们收集的这些曲目听都没有听过。结果呢，就有些收藏家和DJ们为了一些着实普通的唱片却付出了高昂的代价。虽然正宗的深度方克是单曲发行的，但诸如Goldmine、 BBE和Stones Throw这样的唱片行以及Scottish DJ Keb Darge这样的编辑也在极大的程度上帮助这种以单曲发行为主的深度方克最终走向CD的时代立下了汗马功劳。\n\nDeep funk is a term used to describe obscure funk recordings that appeal mostly to zealous collectors and groove fanatics. Like deep soul, the term deep funk can evoke the strongly African-American essence of the music, but deep funk also carries the connotation of a collector digging through crates of old records, looking for that special rare, underground find. It can be vocal or instrumental, but in most cases, it's about rhythm, groove, and musicianship, not songwriting. Deep funk rarely innovates within the form, generally taking its cues from the hard, lean brand of funk epitomized by James Brown and the Meters, or -- depending on the level of musicianship -- moving into jazzier, more improvisational territory. Some of it was recorded for major labels and lost in the shuffle, and some was cut for small independent labels with poor distribution. Whatever the specifics, deep funk represents the sound of funk on its most elemental, grass-roots level; it's something akin to the way '60s garage bands enthusiastically copied their favorite British Invasion or psychedelic records -- some was truly inspired, some just competent, some instantly forgettable. The revival of interest in deep funk is closely tied to the hip-hop movement in America, with its ravenous appetite for fresh sample material, and to the rare groove and Northern soul club scenes in Britain, which place a premium on rediscovering vintage American musical artifacts (in funky jazz and sweet-leaning soul, respectively). In their worst leanings, deep funk collectors are concerned more with the object than the substance, prizing the thrill of the hunt and the single's rarity above its quality -- which is easy to do, since not many people have heard these tracks to begin with. The result is that some collectors and DJs wind up paying exorbitant prices for mediocre music. But at its best, deep funk is about giving credit to the unfairly overlooked -- discovering great grooves and tight combos that really did stack up musically. Although deep funk's true format is the vinyl single, labels like Goldmine, BBE, and Stones Throw, and compilers like Scottish DJ Keb Darge, have helped bring the pleasures of the funky 45 into the CD age.","songs":[{"id":"mQ6sce12fd5","name":"Think of Me","artist":"3Ut66098"},{"id":"xL2rgTdeb73","name":"Sugarland","artist":"b0IMLns3d6b4"},{"id":"b3o4Z13322","name":"Rock Me Again and Again and Again and Again and Again and Again","artist":"Vee9b2c1"},{"id":"xLzEkVa1aaf","name":"Let’s Talk It Over","artist":"5ktd2bce"},{"id":"glFS746bc8","name":"You Can Have Watergate Just Gimme Some Bucks and I'll Be Straight","artist":"Td4b115a"},{"id":"b07iGc55dd","name":"Jingle Belz (Jingle Bells)","artist":"btdBe43b6"},{"id":"b3n5A151b2","name":"Dove","artist":"VeOd2f81"},{"id":"mQ7tHz707eb","name":"It's My Thing, Pt. 1","artist":"bvmbe977e"},{"id":"8Gry0T190b3","name":"Witch Doctor's Brew","artist":"8kzE33f6144"},{"id":"b3CiSbfb43","name":"Intergalactic Love Song","artist":"d0fk40646"},{"id":"mSwV3D5a01b","name":"(☂) Kingz October Top40 2017","artist":"bE6atG786fe"},{"id":"Nrhg5446c","name":"Try It Again","artist":"5db5339f"}],"albums":[{"id":"eJOR74788","name":"Bohannon","artist":"3Ut66098"},{"id":"cOHAhia8067","name":"Do Your Thing","artist":"b0IMLns3d6b4"},{"id":"r0jy20ebc","name":"Check Me Out If You Don't Know...","artist":"Vee9b2c1"},{"id":"drVh35880","name":"Doing It to Death","artist":"Td4b115a"},{"id":"LBI8293b","name":"Christmas Is 4 Ever","artist":"btdBe43b6"},{"id":"8mKd3cce3","name":"On the Move","artist":"5db5339f"},{"id":"jbKtb4479","name":"Cymande","artist":"VeOd2f81"},{"id":"xw0qot9fc8e","name":"Fully Loaded","artist":"8kzE33f6144"},{"id":"iWIQb6918","name":"Gilles Peterson Digs America, ...","artist":"d0fk40646"},{"id":"kigocd13f","name":"It's My Thing","artist":"bvmbe977e"},{"id":"cRUz337a2","name":"Groove Machine","artist":"Td4b115a"},{"id":"eO998bb79","name":"Let's Talk It Over","artist":"5ktd2bce"}],"artists":[{"id":"btdBe43b6","name":"Bootsy Collins"},{"id":"3Ut66098","name":"Hamilton Bohannon"},{"id":"Td4b115a","name":"The J.B.'s"},{"id":"5kh8b6f7","name":"Incredible Bongo Band"},{"id":"bvmbe977e","name":"Marva Whitney"},{"id":"5db5339f","name":"Bobby Byrd"},{"id":"btP9fa7a6","name":"Magnum"},{"id":"Vee9b2c1","name":"Lyn Collins"},{"id":"5ktd2bce","name":"Lee Fields"},{"id":"xxTnUJda868","name":"滑板魔童"},{"id":"5ed4b5cd","name":"Hot Chocolate"},{"id":"Vlcfceae","name":"Kay-Gee's"}]},{"type":"style","id":"434","name":"深度放克复兴 Deep Funk Revival","description":"暂无","songs":[{"id":"mQCjRT6fd68","name":"Medicine Man","artist":"XNraa2e9"},{"id":"b75u4aa485","name":"Budget Fro","artist":"b05wfe39d"},{"id":"mQHvMP7f61c","name":"100 Days, 100 Nights","artist":"5jQ9077c"},{"id":"mQBmP38d96e","name":"Magalenha (Feat.

It is played at a relatively slow tempo and is primarily focused on the intense, intimate lead vocal delivery, emphasizing both the melancholic tone and lyrics, and producing a downbeat, reflective atmosphere. Common instrumental tropes include murky, 'scratchy' guitar sounds, prominent horn sections (accompanying strings more popular in 1970s recordings) and crystalline, spiritual-sounding piano and organ parts. The style declined in popularity in the late 1970s with the emergence of Disco and newer R&B genres. \n\nNotable artists include James Carr, Otis Redding, Percy Sledge, O.V. Wright, Aretha Franklin, Lee Moses and Irma Thomas. \n\nDue to sharing similar influences, southern soul backing and often moods and lyrical fare, some deep soul artists forayed into Country Soul.(By Rateyourmusic)","songs":[{"id":"LMrg56e10","name":"Respect","artist":"Tdl9ff11"},{"id":"b0SN9b8709","name":"After All These Years","artist":"Tczca0f0"},{"id":"b2xxVc184c","name":"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay","artist":"cjhg26822"},{"id":"b2sNHacdfc","name":"Hey Jude","artist":"c9hV2e0b6"},{"id":"KXM895d05","name":"The Dark End of the Street","artist":"Tc4d2840"},{"id":"xLJ8BSae64b","name":"Five Hundred Miles","artist":"5iU7fb30"},{"id":"M0tha82cb","name":"Potty Man","artist":"Vi0bd476"},{"id":"b3CiSbfb43","name":"Intergalactic Love Song","artist":"d0fk40646"},{"id":"K7cG5d76a","name":"Let's Straighten It Out","artist":"btgnf59d6"},{"id":"Mdqt7a1a4","name":"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right","artist":"bJX3243b7"},{"id":"mQPxUP92b87","name":"Can Your Monkey Do The Dog","artist":"bto0179ec"}],"albums":[{"id":"cRNY31ade","name":"I Never Loved a Man the Way I ...","artist":"Tdl9ff11"},{"id":"blKy9c967","name":"Lady Soul","artist":"Tdl9ff11"},{"id":"LJ56e2de","name":"Aretha Now","artist":"Tdl9ff11"},{"id":"L6p7cbb6","name":"Make Do With What You Got","artist":"Tczca0f0"},{"id":"LZ314095","name":"Hey Jude","artist":"c9hV2e0b6"},{"id":"L6m90f9b","name":"Don't Give Up on Me","artist":"Tczca0f0"},{"id":"L79eb68f","name":"You Got My Mind Messed Up","artist":"Tc4d2840"},{"id":"bCdFf6638","name":"The Dock of the Bay","artist":"cjhg26822"},{"id":"bmcHba219","name":"Otis Blue: Otis Redding Sings ...","artist":"cjhg26822"},{"id":"c2cZ29834","name":"In the Midnight Hour","artist":"c9hV2e0b6"},{"id":"CxSr49b3c","name":"Simon Country","artist":"5iU7fb30"},{"id":"MbK75cd1","name":"The Great Otis Redding Sings S...","artist":"cjhg26822"}],"artists":[{"id":"Tdl9ff11","name":"Aretha Franklin"},{"id":"cjhg26822","name":"Otis Redding"},{"id":"Tczca0f0","name":"Solomon Burke"},{"id":"c9hV2e0b6","name":"Wilson Pickett"},{"id":"btf8e6a0d","name":"Percy Sledge"},{"id":"yhDvNq9c5eb","name":"孙旭Trius."},{"id":"3dF5c561","name":"Sam & Dave"},{"id":"bJX3243b7","name":"Millie Jackson"},{"id":"btgnf59d6","name":"O.V.

Doo wop artists were vocal groups, with each singer in the group taking a different part that interweaved with the other singers. Frequently, the backing vocalists sang nonsense words as rhythm, and the genre's name derives from this trait. Most doo wop groups started as a cappella bands, performing without instrumental accompaniment. The hit doo wop singles inspired countless teenagers to form their own a cappella groups, though many of them were never recorded. Despite its a cappella origins, few doo wop records were made without instrumental backing. Doo wop faded away in the early '60s, though its influence was felt throughout popular music in the following decades.","songs":[{"id":"JAKJJi23c10","name":"Rhythm of the

During the '60s, Berry Gordy, Jr.'s Detroit label became the biggest independent in the music industry, thanks to its smooth, sophisticated blend of R&B and memorable pop melodies. At Motown, the pop side of the equation took on greater importance than ever before, which helped make the records accessible to a wider audience; their velvety elegance helped cement black popular music firmly into mainstream American culture. Motown often utilized the same core session musicians on their records, which helped lay the Motown sound's basic rhythmic foundation of bouncing bass and echoing drums. But their arrangements were frequently lush and elaborate, adding strings, horns, woodwinds, piano, extra percussion, or whatever else might enhance the music's urbane stylishness. This polished pop craftsmanship, when matched with the smoothly soulful vocals of the Motown artist roster, became ubiquitously popular during the early '60s, with songwriters like Smokey Robinson and the team of Eddie Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Brian Holland turning out one gem after another with almost assembly-line regularity. When Holland, Dozier and Holland left the label in a dispute over royalties, producer Norman Whitfield became a major figure at Motown, keeping the label in step with the harder, funkier direction much soul music was heading in. In 1970, the Jackson 5 became superstars with a funky bubblegum-soul that began to break away from established Motown formulas, and during the rest of the decade, performers like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder took greater control of their own music, investing it with their own personalities and helping break up the standardized Motown blueprint. It's that blueprint, which brought artists like the Temptations, Four Tops, and Supremes stardom, that people mean when they describe music as \"Motown.\"","songs":[{"id":"chcAqfae44","name":"Superstition","artist":"btgkff04f"},{"id":"LQbC66aef","name":"What's Going On","artist":"c9gQ2eb3e"},{"id":"mQ3JqO64d36","name":"My Girl","artist":"TeNe03ee"},{"id":"M0CTea725","name":"Hello","artist":"Te1c86a6"},{"id":"LZWV71282","name":"Ben","artist":"3c862f8e"},{"id":"ciz3Df348a","name":"Let's Do It","artist":"3dB62f9f"},{"id":"cNQUE2561d","name":"I'll Be There","artist":"Tdyd7642"},{"id":"b0x7vd7195","name":"Second That Emotion","artist":"SIDc14dc"},{"id":"b1pTPm43ee01","name":"War","artist":"dbmm5fe96"},{"id":"8FZSiEf5623","name":"Please Mr. Postman","artist":"dzjt40139"},{"id":"xLsfnac5e0c","name":"My Guy ","artist":"cjhO2bd2b"},{"id":"xLtkqU9970a","name":"Reach Out I'll Be There","artist":"3cq8ff8e"}],"albums":[{"id":"bmrab8484","name":"Talking Book","artist":"btgkff04f"},{"id":"drQ13a134","name":"What's Going On","artist":"c9gQ2eb3e"},{"id":"obrW1cde8","name":"The Ultimate Collection","artist":"TeNe03ee"},{"id":"dHRx6b773","name":"Let's Get It On","artist":"c9gQ2eb3e"},{"id":"ksVJd982c","name":"Can't Slow Down","artist":"Te1c86a6"},{"id":"LPva27d5","name":"Ben","artist":"3c862f8e"},{"id":"blPsdde0d","name":"Third Album","artist":"Tdyd7642"},{"id":"Mqj8031b","name":"Songs in the Key of Life","artist":"btgkff04f"},{"id":"gdu27cbef","name":"The Definitive Collection","artist":"btgkff04f"},{"id":"cSil2fca0","name":"Blue","artist":"3dB62f9f"},{"id":"b4w4f450f","name":"Motown Two","artist":"SIDc14dc"},{"id":"Mdj8eb58","name":"Diana Ross","artist":"3dB62f9f"}],"artists":[{"id":"btgkff04f","name":"Stevie Wonder"},{"id":"c9gQ2eb3e","name":"Marvin Gaye"},{"id":"3b06cbe6","name":"Boyz II Men"},{"id":"3dB62f9f","name":"Diana Ross"},{"id":"Tdyd7642","name":"The Jackson 5"},{"id":"TeNe03ee","name":"The Temptations"},{"id":"dPlf48378","name":"The Supremes"},{"id":"btfxfe304","name":"Smokey Robinson"},{"id":"bz2xf5bb6","name":"Smokey Robinson & the Miracles"},{"id":"bviDed7fc","name":"The Undisputed Truth"},{"id":"Ve9cbfe8","name":"Willie Hutch"},{"id":"daan3a31e","name":"Eddie Kendricks"}]},{"type":"style","id":"377","name":"新杰克摇摆乐 New Jack Swing","description":"New jack swing是一种R&B和Hip-Hop融合的曲风，从80年代晚期到90年代早期和中期开始流行。这种曲风融合了非典型Hip-Hop中的\"Swing\"节拍(这种节拍源自于大量的运用有节奏的即兴创作)和当代R&B的演唱风格，在Hip-Hop黄金年代非常流行。\n\nNew Jack Swing evolved in the late '80s, when urban contemporary soul artists began incorporating hip-hop rhythms, samples, and production techniques into their sound.

Northern soul mainly consists of a particular style of black American soul music based on the heavy beat and fast tempo of the mid-1960s Tamla Motown sound.\n\nThe northern soul movement, however, generally eschews Motown or Motown-influenced music that has met with significant mainstream success. The recordings most prized by enthusiasts of the genre are usually by lesser-known artists, released only in limited numbers, often by small regional American labels such as Ric-Tic and Golden World Records (Detroit), Mirwood (Los Angeles) and Shout and Okeh (New York/Chicago).\nNorthern soul is associated with particular dance styles and fashions that grew out of the underground rhythm & soul scene of the late 1960s at venues such as the Twisted Wheel in Manchester. This scene and the associated dances and fashions quickly spread to other UK dancehalls and nightclubs like the Chateau Impney (Droitwich), Catacombs (Wolverhampton), the Highland Rooms at Blackpool Mecca, Golden Torch (Stoke-on-Trent) and Wigan Casino.\n\nAs the favoured beat became more uptempo and frantic, by the early 1970s, northern soul dancing became more athletic, somewhat resembling the later dance styles of disco and break dancing. Featuring spins, flips, karate kicks and backdrops, club dancing styles were often inspired by the stage performances of touring American soul acts such as Little Anthony & The Imperials and Jackie Wilson.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, popular Northern Soul records generally dated from the mid-1960s. This meant that the movement was sustained (and \"new\" recordings added to playlists) by prominent DJs discovering rare and previously overlooked records. Later on, certain clubs and DJs began to move away from the 1960s Motown sound and began to play newer releases with a more contemporary sound.","songs":[{"id":"xL1gmYad257","name":"Love Me Again","artist":"mlQGxw4ffd5"},{"id":"mQ5Ywq78254","name":"Stronger (Extended Club Mix)","artist":"JL26e199"},{"id":"b2qrz1615c","name":"Trapped by a Thing Called Love","artist":"5hT64c7f"},{"id":"b2qkKcc13a","name":"You Don't Know Me at All","artist":"5hU6db3b"},{"id":"xLy1Kcab6ad","name":"Powerful Love","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"8G36HEe5fcb","name":"Born Under A Bad Sign","artist":"btdje67e2"},{"id":"T9K09c1a8","name":"Bad Girl, Pt. 1","artist":"bTHH1f124"},{"id":"cmHvRef3f1","name":"Let's Stay Together","artist":"ZyOba7e8"},{"id":"MuHg55ec7","name":"Sweet Dynamite!","artist":"cBmw33502"},{"id":"b2gli1661d","name":"Just the Lonely Talking Again","artist":"3cV5d83f"},{"id":"mQJIY863711","name":"Rescue Me","artist":"bveMffbd5"},{"id":"b2RvJ101ea","name":"I Can't Stop My Heart","artist":"UZYc8d89"}],"albums":[{"id":"sRHQxa7093","name":"Tribute","artist":"mlQGxw4ffd5"},{"id":"kaLkad892","name":"Stronger","artist":"JL26e199"},{"id":"3ZXb367c9","name":"Trapped By a Thing Called Love","artist":"5hT64c7f"},{"id":"f0bD8f30e","name":"Time and Place","artist":"bTHH1f124"},{"id":"jbnPd2529","name":"The Scene of the Crime","artist":"5hU6db3b"},{"id":"bBVPf66a2","name":"One Life to Live","artist":"3cV5d83f"},{"id":"d1Zpvffa8ed","name":"This Is Where I Live","artist":"btdje67e2"},{"id":"nQoifd8ea","name":"S.O.B.","artist":"EjL893ad"},{"id":"CypX4474c","name":"Talkin' About Chicago","artist":"cBmw33502"},{"id":"bl3ib9d94","name":"Bound to Happen","artist":"btdje67e2"},{"id":"jbRVd11ce","name":"The New Look","artist":"bveMffbd5"},{"id":"dIau43573","name":"Sweet Talk","artist":"3cV5d83f"}],"artists":[{"id":"2Jp6bf72","name":"The Pretenders"},{"id":"SZ4b619a","name":"Marlena Shaw"},{"id":"5hU6db3b","name":"Bettye LaVette"},{"id":"dbmm5fe96","name":"Edwin Starr"},{"id":"3cV5d83f","name":"The Manhattans"},{"id":"bJX3243b7","name":"Millie Jackson"},{"id":"5hN66c7a","name":"Major Harris"},{"id":"cBmw33502","name":"Syl Johnson"},{"id":"dziM41867","name":"The Impressions"},{"id":"5hT64c7f","name":"Denise LaSalle"},{"id":"5hw7a6e5","name":"Leon Haywood"},{"id":"SPrde8b9","name":"Ernestine Anderson"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3081","name":"P放克 P-Funk","description":"P放克（P-Funk，P Funk 或 P.

Smokey Robinson's like-titled hit single, \"A Quiet Storm\", released in 1975 as the title track to his third solo album, lent its name to the format and to the radio program that introduced it to the public. Encompassing a mix of African-American music genres, quiet storm music is distinguished by understated, mellow dynamics and relaxed tempos and rhythms. It can be soothingly pensive, or express romantic sentiment. Quiet storm music is similar to soft rock styles, but it is more closely and unmistakably rooted in R&B and soul music, often with jazz extensions.\n\nToday, quiet storm is a broad term given to an array of mellow, slow-groove contemporary R&B, soul and smooth jazz offerings of the type featured on Melvin Lindsey's WHUR program, and on myriad other stations that followed his lead—most notably KBLX-FM in San Francisco, which in 1979 became the first radio station in the U.S. to present a 24-hour quiet storm format (which lasted 32 years, until the station was acquired in April 2011 by Entercom Broadcasting and converted to straight-ahead Urban AC format).","songs":[{"id":"xL9KGpb1178","name":"Nothing's Gonna Change My Love For You","artist":"2OP57a42"},{"id":"M0CTea725","name":"Hello","artist":"Te1c86a6"},{"id":"xL3lJAdc451","name":"Oh Honey","artist":"C6A70f2b"},{"id":"bAN6gcbf70","name":"Dance With My Father","artist":"Tfaa9743"},{"id":"ciX2Lf2996","name":"Forget Me Nots","artist":"cjbL3e326"},{"id":"b4ocw12a70","name":"My Flame","artist":"4L37ddc2"},{"id":"bAIssd4973","name":"It's Gonna Be Right","artist":"ebqh49ed6"},{"id":"d36Rm27c5d","name":"Let's Groove","artist":"3ce6a825"},{"id":"UAzl5c056","name":"Streets of Philadelphia","artist":"dOT546572"},{"id":"mQA4ji4d03a","name":"Doin' It","artist":"iOCDb277c"},{"id":"xLoUKsda415","name":"Love's Theme","artist":"Tfid67b3"},{"id":"b0719c665b","name":"Easy","artist":"3bO68e7a"}],"albums":[{"id":"fvvm8e235","name":"Eau De Vie","artist":"C6A70f2b"},{"id":"mpKrkQ9417e","name":"The Ultimate Collection","artist":"2OP57a42"},{"id":"Dgu048757","name":"Lovesongs","artist":"Tfaa9743"},{"id":"ksVJd982c","name":"Can't Slow Down","artist":"Te1c86a6"},{"id":"rVMr21de9","name":"The Promise of Love","artist":"C6A70f2b"},{"id":"jQix10f95","name":"Gold: The Very Best of Barry W...","artist":"Tfid67b3"},{"id":"Dhbe4aff0","name":"More Bounce to the Ounce and O...","artist":"Fwy4edbf"},{"id":"eSQJ69aba","name":"What You Won't Do for Love","artist":"4L37ddc2"},{"id":"f7QM74291","name":"We Can Make You Dance: The Zap...","artist":"Fwy4edbf"},{"id":"o1RLeedb3","name":"The Look of Love: The Burt Bac...","artist":"SDwcae28"},{"id":"c0od2aa15","name":"Straight from the Heart","artist":"cjbL3e326"},{"id":"kjkcb0395","name":"The Ultimate Collection","artist":"cjgd2c6a9"}],"artists":[{"id":"cjgd2c6a9","name":"Whitney Houston"},{"id":"Tci14b2e","name":"Babyface"},{"id":"c9gQ2eb3e","name":"Marvin Gaye"},{"id":"Te1c86a6","name":"Lionel Richie"},{"id":"3Wt63792","name":"Brian McKnight"},{"id":"Tdl9ff11","name":"Aretha Franklin"},{"id":"3ce6a825","name":"Earth, Wind & Fire"},{"id":"Tfaa9743","name":"Luther Vandross"},{"id":"bfNwi5D49d5e","name":"Angel Baby"},{"id":"4L37ddc2","name":"Bobby Caldwell"},{"id":"C6A70f2b","name":"Delegation"},{"id":"Tdfaba68","name":"Roberta Flack"}]},{"type":"style","id":"428","name":"柔顺灵魂乐 Smooth Soul","description":"柔顺灵魂乐（Smooth Soul）是灵魂乐（Soul）的子风格，在1970年代的美国，由放克（Funk）、流行乐（Pop）及灵魂乐（Soul）发展而来，到1970年代获得商业成功。后来由于迪斯科（Disco）和平静风暴（Quiet Storm）等风格的流行而退出主流舞台。Smooth Soul的基本特征是鲜明的旋律走向，融合Funk的元素和光洁的制作手法。\n\n基本特征\nAllmusic描述Smooth Soul为\"光滑、时髦和浪漫\"。和流行灵魂乐（Pop Soul）受到当时的舞曲启发不同，Smooth Soul里更多的是情歌的浪漫以及尘俗的歌词主题。然而，和Pop Soul一样，Smooth Soul的鲜明旋律也让它成为跨界演绎的良好素材。而Funk对Smooth Soul节奏的影响则让它与一般流行乐区分开来。\n\n流行时段\n1970年代\n\n英文简介\nSmooth soul is a subgenre of soul music that developed in the early 1970s from soul, funk and pop music in the United States.

The funk influence of smooth soul's beats also gave the subgenre its distinction from pop.\n\nThe music enjoyed commercial success during the early to mid-1970s through the works of such artists as Al Green, The Spinners, Marvin Gaye, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, Bill Withers, Minnie Riperton, Earth, Wind & Fire and The Stylistics.Well-known works of the smooth soul genre include Let's Get It On (1973), Spinners (1972), Just as I Am and Let's Stay Together (1972).As pop-soul had metamorphosed into disco during the late 1970s,smooth soul was eventually followed by the development of the quiet storm format.","songs":[{"id":"b15Q29c556","name":"Fairy Tale","artist":"Tcv9c577"},{"id":"Lc5Pd5a57","name":"Somebody Already Broke My Heart","artist":"3dE6d836"},{"id":"b1GTkd104f","name":"Killing Me Softly With His Song","artist":"Tdfaba68"},{"id":"mQ4XqL67740","name":"September","artist":"3ce6a825"},{"id":"8GjRqYf61df","name":"Open","artist":"8ena41c36"},{"id":"xLqc8hd6d8a","name":"The Look of Love","artist":"2Mp7c3b8"},{"id":"bf05mSk2fd66","name":"Roller Coaster","artist":"Tcv9c577"},{"id":"LQbC66aef","name":"What's Going On","artist":"c9gQ2eb3e"},{"id":"LSd177c13","name":"Let's Stay Together","artist":"3cx73f37"},{"id":"chaufefb07","name":"Love Makin' Music","artist":"Tfid67b3"},{"id":"Ou7w82585","name":"Lovin' You","artist":"5iO644ca"},{"id":"b1ehcd6363","name":"Ain't No Sunshine","artist":"3eu8edee"}],"albums":[{"id":"ehAO47036","name":"The Heat","artist":"Tcv9c577"},{"id":"oV8ufb995","name":"Woman","artist":"8ena41c36"},{"id":"bB51fafff","name":"Libra","artist":"Tcv9c577"},{"id":"bmeTc8994","name":"Lovers Rock","artist":"3dE6d836"},{"id":"gzAk6eaf7","name":"Unbreak My Heart","artist":"Tcv9c577"},{"id":"bBJLeb0dd","name":"Killing Me Softly","artist":"Tdfaba68"},{"id":"drQ13a134","name":"What's Going On","artist":"c9gQ2eb3e"},{"id":"fJSO86907","name":"Dusty: The Very Best of Dusty ...","artist":"2Mp7c3b8"},{"id":"LLT5adf6","name":"Let's Stay Together","artist":"3cx73f37"},{"id":"dHRx6b773","name":"Let's Get It On","artist":"c9gQ2eb3e"},{"id":"bmoYc20e8","name":"Sheet Music","artist":"Tfid67b3"},{"id":"jUWf146aa","name":"The Definitive Greatest Hits","artist":"3cx73f37"}],"artists":[{"id":"3dE6d836","name":"Sade"},{"id":"btgkff04f","name":"Stevie Wonder"},{"id":"Tcv9c577","name":"Toni Braxton"},{"id":"c9gQ2eb3e","name":"Marvin Gaye"},{"id":"3ce6a825","name":"Earth, Wind & Fire"},{"id":"8ena41c36","name":"Rhye"},{"id":"Tfaa9743","name":"Luther Vandross"},{"id":"3cx73f37","name":"Al Green"},{"id":"Tfid67b3","name":"Barry White"},{"id":"2Mp7c3b8","name":"Dusty Springfield"},{"id":"Teh21c6a","name":"Aaron Neville"},{"id":"Tdfaba68","name":"Roberta Flack"}]},{"type":"style","id":"424","name":"南方灵魂乐 Southern Soul","description":"南方灵魂乐（Southern Soul）是灵魂乐（Soul）的子风格，在1950年代末，1960年代初出现在美国南方。它是很多风格的混合，比如布鲁斯（Blues）、乡村（Country）、早期的摇滚（Rock and Roll）和美国黑人教堂的福音歌曲。关于Southern Soul的焦点并不在它的歌词，而在于它的律动（Groove）。它的鲜明的节奏特点也让它对放克（Funk）的形成有强烈的影响。\n\n基本特征\nSouthern Soul是比较粗粝、有Funky感觉的灵魂乐。它拥有南方福音（Southern gospel）的热情，也有R&B的能量。 它的元素通常包括一位热情的福音歌手、强劲的圆号、鸡抓(Chicken-scratch)节奏吉他以及紧致的节奏。\n\n流行时段\n1960年代，1990年代后有复兴\n\n英文简介\nSouthern soul is a type of soul music that emerged from the Southern United States.

Like quiet storm and Philly soul, both strong influences, urban was very smooth and polished, but while its romantic ballads fit well into quiet storm radio formats, urban also had room for uptempo, funky dance tracks, which usually boasted the same high-tech, radio-ready production and controlled yet soulful vocals. That's why, in spite of its name, urban didn't usually have the earthy grit associated with the term \"soul music,\" preferring to tone down the raw emotion in favor of a slick refinement. Up until the late '80s, most urban music was highly pop-oriented, often in melody but nearly always in terms of production. A number of artists -- like Janet Jackson, Billy Ocean, and Whitney Houston -- crossed over from the R&B charts to the pop charts, although there were others like Freddie Jackson, Luther Vandross, Stephanie Mills, and Levert whose R&B popularity never translated quite the same way. The urban landscape began to shift with the advent of hip-hop; producer and Guy member Teddy Riley crafted a fusion of the two, inserted occasional rap breaks, and dubbed it new jack swing. New jack made a superstar of Bobby Brown and proved greatly beneficial to his ex-New Edition mates as well. In addition to Riley, songwriting/production duos whose work straddled pop and R&B -- like Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis (Janet Jackson), Denzil Foster & Thomas McElroy (En Vogue), and Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid & Babyface -- dominated urban music at the turn of the decade, with Babyface going on to a hugely successful singing career in his own right. Urban and hip-hop continued to cross-pollinate during the early '90s, eventually resulting in a new hybrid tagged \"hip-hop soul.\" Hip-hop soul was rooted in new jack swing, but the beats were funkier, more elastic and unpredictable; while hip-hop soul was still slickly produced, it had a grittier, more soulful feel than new jack. There was still a side of urban that retained roots in quiet storm and adult contemporary, though, and regardless of which side of the spectrum they fell on, the songs were increasingly becoming showpieces for elaborate vocal technique.

Along with the blues, its forefather, it is one of the first truly indigenous musics to develop in America, yet its unpredictable, risky ventures into improvisation gave it critical cache with scholars that the blues lacked. At the outset, jazz was dance music, performed by swinging big bands. Soon, the dance elements faded into the background and improvisation became the key element of the music. As the genre evolved, the music split into a number of different styles, from the speedy, hard-hitting rhythms of be-bop and the laid-back, mellow harmonies of cool jazz to the jittery, atonal forays of free jazz and the earthy grooves of soul jazz. What tied it all together was a foundation in the blues, a reliance on group interplay and unpredictable improvisation. Throughout the years, and in all the different styles, those are the qualities that defined jazz.","songs":[{"id":"ckB1Wf7591","name":"一生所爱","artist":"iuzfce26"},{"id":"mQLB0t5d5cd","name":"The Runaround","artist":"cxVW29006"},{"id":"fQ65609d6","name":"Let's Start From Here","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"OEjx559b4","name":"Don't Know Why","artist":"6ff931a3"},{"id":"b4FaKa5a11","name":"Nine Million Bicycles","artist":"6h57b32d"},{"id":"ch4v7fc27b","name":"What a Wonderful World","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"TBmS6e572","name":"La Vie En Rose ","artist":"6hG7d2d1"},{"id":"ViXr56d61","name":"Give Me That Slow Knowing Smile","artist":"bwgYe403b"},{"id":"mQ351u575c6","name":"Can't Take My Eyes Off You","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"b4BFWab3a7","name":"I Don't Miss You Anymore","artist":"bwgYe403b"},{"id":"epnmR2ea9b","name":"Sympathique","artist":"batncf157"},{"id":"b1pRdKW42d02","name":"Every Breath You Take","artist":"bCRXe9e33"}],"albums":[{"id":"jNMLc699c","name":"Mirror","artist":"bfEIb0c67"},{"id":"byCA18390","name":"Start From Here","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"fUry981c9","name":"A Cup Of Coffee","artist":"bfEIb0c67"},{"id":"8qPI3e981","name":"Come Away With Me","artist":"6ff931a3"},{"id":"klmm11f4d","name":"My View","artist":"b7mee85ad"},{"id":"jfX796ed2","name":"Feels Like Home","artist":"6ff931a3"},{"id":"mZAUt154dac","name":"The Same Sun","artist":"cxVW29006"},{"id":"jgmjab0f1","name":"Piece by Piece","artist":"6h57b32d"},{"id":"0Z0A315db","name":"Essentials","artist":"bCRXe9e33"},{"id":"oiS3e603e","name":"Everlasting Truth","artist":"ICG4b6ec"},{"id":"nRb9e68ef","name":"Love Ballads","artist":"buAEf05dc"},{"id":"F7K7a51c","name":"What a Wonderful World","artist":"SPub7bf6"}],"artists":[{"id":"hgja759c","name":"王若琳"},{"id":"6ff931a3","name":"Norah Jones"},{"id":"6hG7d2d1","name":"小野リサ"},{"id":"lbPox5b329","name":"Amy Winehouse"},{"id":"gWPc4394","name":"坂本龍一"},{"id":"OUz8a783","name":"袁娅维"},{"id":"cKig2d251","name":"Sia"},{"id":"hd5c8555","name":"椎名林檎"},{"id":"SPub7bf6","name":"Louis Armstrong"},{"id":"buAEf05dc","name":"Kenny G"},{"id":"cClP2ee41","name":"Michael Bublé"},{"id":"6h57b32d","name":"Katie Melua"}],"styles":[{"type":"style","id":"838","name":"爵士 Jazz","description":"jazz即爵士乐源于蓝音，是一种从前居住在美国南部的非洲奴隶以及他们的后代们的民间音乐。蓝调深受西非文化和音乐传统的影响，这些奴隶也逐渐成为移居到城市的黑人的音乐家.\n爵士乐的真正起源是贫穷。 1865年，美国内战结束，往日黑人奴隶获得了自由，但是生活依然困苦。他们多数是文盲，唯有靠自己故土培植出的音乐娱乐自己。劳动的号子和农田歌曲是在采摘棉花时候唱的，赞美诗歌和圣歌是在种族隔离的教堂里聚会时唱的，而即兴之作则是独唱歌手在一只班卓琴伴奏下吟唱的。在教堂中，黑人牧师借用英国领唱方式来解决唱歌不懂字的问题。\n上世纪之交流行的音乐会标准的形式，也就是当时军乐团和舞曲乐队的音乐影响了最早的爵士乐的主流表达方式。这些音乐的乐器：铜管乐器，簧管乐器和鼓成为了爵士乐的基本乐器。\n爵士乐(Jazz)以其极具动感的切分节奏、个性十足的爵士音阶和不失章法的即兴演奏（或演唱）赢得了广大听众的喜爱，同时也得到了音乐领域各界人士的认可。它以布鲁斯和拉格泰姆为源头，经过整整一个世纪的发展，如今已是异彩纷呈、百花齐放。自从1917年第一张爵士唱片诞生以来,它便显示出了巨大的发展潜力。20世纪初的新奥尔良爵士乐 、30 年代大乐队演奏的摇摆乐、40年代的比博普爵士、40 年代末的冷爵士、50年代的硬博普、60 年代的自由爵士、70 年代以后的摇滚爵士，而后拉丁爵士、融合爵士、爵士放克…… 一张张不同风格的爵士唱片汇成了一部爵士乐发展史。\nJazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime. Jazz is seen by many as \"America's classical music\". Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \"one of America's original art forms\"\n\nClassic Jazz refers more to a transitional era (1920s), rather than any specific style. During the 1920s jazz slowly shifted from the exuberant New Orleans and Dixieland styles toward a more sophisticated and urbane swing style. Many artists who participated in this transition had careers that overlapped into Dixieland in the early 20s, and into swing in the middle 30s. Not only was the music shifting during this time, but the performing ensembles were growing bigger as more dance orchestras began to use jazz elements creating a big band jazz/pop hybrid that would lead to the classic big bands of the swing era.\n\nThe leaders of classic 1920s jazz are orchestra leader Fletcher Henderson and his star soloist, Louis Armstrong. The Henderson orchestra did away with the constant polyphonic soloing of New Orleans jazz and replaced it with cool relaxed riffing which provided a background for Armstrong's expressive melodies and exciting solos. Classic jazz is still played by jazz lovers all over the world, although not always with the right feel.","songs":[{"id":"mQ351u575c6","name":"Can't Take My Eyes Off You","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"b1pRdKW42d02","name":"Every Breath You Take","artist":"bCRXe9e33"},{"id":"8GarkTf6ef1","name":"Love, Don’t Let Me Go","artist":"bzfNf4bf8"},{"id":"b6XC9d587f","name":"Ya Tebya Lubliu","artist":"bzGzf1b6a"},{"id":"bqvni863c2c2","name":"Tangled Up","artist":"bista5aa6"},{"id":"xLtwABa9c8d","name":"Larmes de caramel","artist":"Ng98d3af"},{"id":"b1pO3r43e0e4","name":"Chocolate & Chili","artist":"EFA816c7"},{"id":"xLoO1bbeff4","name":"When Lights Are Low","artist":"b6KMf667b"},{"id":"b1qlqwq4367a","name":"A Casual Encounter","artist":"nmSuGy8373f"},{"id":"mQ4mUH8bdc2","name":"It's a Beautiful Day","artist":"bhlZa921f"},{"id":"cql8ye4d22","name":"Every Breath You Take","artist":"EDn6c99a"},{"id":"xLqzIod9e29","name":"Sleep Away","artist":"biNCe0557"}],"albums":[{"id":"0Z0A315db","name":"Essentials","artist":"bCRXe9e33"},{"id":"jXP6a61e5","name":"Song Book: 20 Jazz Greatest","artist":"6pD6b98c"},{"id":"f6ob4e910","name":"Joanna & 王若琳","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"fJxg58d38","name":"大人故事书 亚洲巡回演唱会影音全纪录","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"kNhKa48d6","name":"Instrumental Music To Love, Sm...","artist":"iUXJb756f"},{"id":"8oOZy3f9e5a","name":"The Shocking Miss Emerald","artist":"bista5aa6"},{"id":"fBT680ef2","name":"The Adult Storybook","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"fFWT71c6f","name":"Good News","artist":"bzfNf4bf8"},{"id":"jPFmbd01c","name":"Moon of Manakoora","artist":"b6KMf667b"},{"id":"knSFbdf63","name":"Acoustic Joys","artist":"Ng98d3af"},{"id":"jrGFaf419","name":"Pass the Information","artist":"nmSuGy8373f"},{"id":"4Qqn3793e","name":"Swop","artist":"bhlZa921f"}],"artists":[{"id":"OUz8a783","name":"袁娅维"},{"id":"hd5c8555","name":"椎名林檎"},{"id":"SPub7bf6","name":"Louis Armstrong"},{"id":"cClP2ee41","name":"Michael Bublé"},{"id":"bISR259a0","name":"Nat King Cole"},{"id":"SP3dae8b","name":"Chet Baker"},{"id":"mQOu3u7b1f8","name":"FKJ"},{"id":"cYWX3bd36","name":"Ella Fitzgerald"},{"id":"ICG4b6ec","name":"Re:plus"},{"id":"SUd1020e","name":"Billie Holiday"},{"id":"bir6b31e4","name":"Kenichiro Nishihara"},{"id":"SU79f012","name":"Keith Jarrett"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1155","name":"巴萨诺瓦 Bossa Nova","description":"巴萨诺瓦(Bossa Nova)是一种融合巴西森巴舞曲和美国酷派爵士的一种“新派爵士乐”，承袭choro和samba-cancao的部分特色而又自成一格，乍听简洁轻快。巴萨诺瓦结构复杂；乐器的音阶或和弦转换的行进方式变幻莫测，往往乍听下以为可以掌握旋律的起落和节奏，和弦一转换后即捕足不及。它的旋律可以是行板或中板速度进行。\n\n语源\n\n巴萨诺瓦(Bossa Nova)是葡萄牙文，Bossa原意是演奏Samba时的自然风格与气质，Nova则是新的意思。结合起来，Bossa Nova就是一种融合了传统巴西森巴(samba)节奏与啼乐(choro)的一种\"新派音乐\"。正统的Bossa Nova的起源是南美洲巴西土生土长的音乐，之后流传到北美洲之后广为爵士乐坛所喜爱，由美国爵士乐手大力推广。也因此“Bossa Nova是拉丁爵士的一种”的这个印象，已经是后来的事情了。\n\n风格\n\n巴萨诺瓦的字面意思是“新节奏”，原来是一种拉丁音乐，听起来轻松柔和、慵懒甜美、浪漫性感。与传统南美及拉丁音乐不同的是，巴萨诺瓦不像森巴或伦巴(Rumba)那样节奏强烈，除拥有南美音乐的热情外，还带有一份慵懒和轻松的感觉。\n\n历史\n\n巴萨诺瓦在1950年代末期的巴西兴起。 1959年，由法国导演Marcel Camus执导的巴西电影“黑色奥菲斯”(Black Orpheus)勇夺康城电影节、奥斯卡、金球奖三项最佳外语片奖； 带有巴萨诺瓦风格的电影主题曲“A Felicidade”和“Desafinado”风行一时，人们开始对巴萨诺瓦产生兴趣。1960年代美国更掀起一阵巴萨诺瓦风潮，延烧到世界各地，影响了往后1970、80年代的电影及流行音乐。\n\n著名音乐人\n\nAntonio Carlos Jobim(1927-1994，巴西作曲家，巴萨诺瓦之父)\nThe Girl From Ipanema\nMeditation\nÁgua de Beber\nDesafinado\nCorcovado\nHow Insensitive一\nAstrud Gilberto(João Gilberto前妻)\n王俪婷 Olivia Ong\nRosalia de Souza\nCibelle\nStan Getz(1927-1991年)\nThe Girl From Ipanema\n小野丽莎(Lisa Ono，小野リサ)\n\n在亚洲的发展\n\n日本在1960年代中期就流行巴萨诺瓦，闻名国际的萨克斯风手渡边贞夫就是日本推动巴萨诺瓦的先锋。日本的许多音乐人常表演巴萨诺瓦；除渡边贞夫外，还有李敬子、小野丽莎、铃木重子等爵士艺人，都有不少巴萨诺瓦的作品，其中小野丽莎更被定位为巴萨诺瓦歌手。\n踏入21世纪，巴萨诺瓦在台湾开始有流行的趋势，频频在广告中出现，可说是历久弥新的“新节奏”。\n\nBossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music, which was developed and popularized in the 1950s and 1960s and is today one of the best-known Brazilian music genres abroad. The phrase bossa nova means literally \"new trend\" or \"new wave\" (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈbɔsɐ ˈnɔvɐ] (About this sound listen)). A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students.\nAlthough it had been developing throughout the 50s, Bossa Nova became popular in the early 60s as a more mellow alternative to the aggressive urban sounds of hard bop and the avant-garde. Bossa Nova was a Brazilian concoction that combined simplified and slowed down samba rhythms, relaxed cool jazz sensibilities and modern European impressionistic harmonies into a music that was pleasing, but hardly simplistic. The pulsing relaxed rhythm, marked with hypnotic accents, that defines Bossa Nova can be heard in the songs and guitar rhythms of Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim.","songs":[{"id":"TBmS6e572","name":"La Vie En Rose ","artist":"6hG7d2d1"},{"id":"b4BFWab3a7","name":"I Don't Miss You Anymore","artist":"bwgYe403b"},{"id":"b4Fh0c93f8","name":"The Clouds in

music, or simply swing, is a form of popular music developed in the United States that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the off–beat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb \"to swing\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, Woody Herman, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Shep Fields, Sammy Kaye, Harry James and Cab Calloway.\n\nThe Swing genre represents a golden age for jazz that showed its first signs in the mid-20s, but really peaked from the mid-30s to the mid-40s. Going well into the 20s, most jazz bands still played in New Orleans or Dixieland styles in which the musicians all improvised simultaneously while staying within the boundaries of the original tune's melody and harmony.\n\nWhen cornetist Louis Armstrong joined Fletcher Henderson's Orchestra in 1924, the band's arranger, Don Redman, knew he had a rare talent on his hands and began to spotlight Armstrong's melodic skills. No longer would the entire band improvise, instead Armstrong would be given the freedom to take solos to new heights while the rest of the band supplied supporting riffs. This new approach to band arranging spread and reached the public at a time when people were looking for large orchestral bands that could provide an evening's worth of dance music. Thus the golden age for big band jazz was born.\n\nFrom 1935 to about 1946 jazz dance bands led by the likes of Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington were the number one form of entertainment in the US. The swing era finally came to an end when new taxation laws on nightclubs made dance floors unprofitable and jazz became an entertainment for listening, not dancing.","songs":[{"id":"b15KLd3709","name":"Somethin' Stupid","artist":"T33dc99b"},{"id":"bf0uoJB34052","name":"Jingle Bells ","artist":"Ti0b5305"},{"id":"fFcD53d922","name":"Ain't That A Kick In The Head","artist":"dTsD483f0"},{"id":"eiv1333fb2","name":"L-O-V-E","artist":"btdAf9ae5"},{"id":"xLsiquf2b92","name":"I Can't Give You Anything But Love","artist":"bJa324d3f"},{"id":"bf0xmP1307e5","name":"The Way You Look Tonight","artist":"bwkd183b2"},{"id":"xLqismd2d30","name":"Levitation (Ver. 2.0)","artist":"I8w7f2c6"},{"id":"b2ANad6421","name":"You Look Good to Me","artist":"SYmdced6"},{"id":"xNds9md5c62","name":"Rollin","artist":"8a163fcf2"},{"id":"MVZ34e9fb","name":"Jingle Bells","artist":"4tn8f358"},{"id":"chePGf7912","name":"I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)","artist":"bsTQe2ca5"},{"id":"bCk7wXj6dfa8","name":"(Back Home Again In) Indiana","artist":"SQwcedf4"}],"albums":[{"id":"fn0jVa2090b","name":"Swings Both Ways","artist":"T33dc99b"},{"id":"nbOHfd2b4","name":"Swing When You're Winning","artist":"T33dc99b"},{"id":"czUT28372","name":"Moonglow","artist":"SYtde4d4"},{"id":"xWbqgfdd182","name":"摇摆电力公司","artist":"dmU63a80"},{"id":"fGSL7cebb","name":"His All Time Greatest Hits: 30...","artist":"4s8949c9"},{"id":"f9DK65cb1","name":"Dino","artist":"dTsD483f0"},{"id":"blCfad6ed","name":"Unforgettable...

Generally, smooth jazz relies on rhythms and grooves instead of improvisation. There are layers of synthesizers, lite-funk rhythms, lite-funk bass, elastic guitars, and either trumpets, alto, or soprano saxophones. The music isn't cerebral, like hard bop, nor is it gritty and funky like soul-jazz or groove -- it is unobtrusive, slick, and highly polished, where the overall sound matters more than the individual parts.","songs":[{"id":"8Gcbnge379d","name":"Heart and Soul","artist":"buAEf05dc"},{"id":"cPXlY23c8e","name":"I Believe","artist":"buNce61c7"},{"id":"VfoE76edd","name":"Emmanuel (Live) ","artist":"buNofd03a"},{"id":"OEnr577ed","name":"It's Oh So Quiet","artist":"bwgYe403b"},{"id":"b4LM4b0fd8","name":"Drive Time","artist":"Wqncb23f"},{"id":"R4da6e70c","name":"Twilight","artist":"b00ufc6ea"},{"id":"mQ7n6X8de8c","name":"Canon","artist":"di8f3ba6f"},{"id":"eiv1333fb2","name":"L-O-V-E","artist":"btdAf9ae5"},{"id":"Q8ls80ffa","name":"Sway","artist":"cphD27814"},{"id":"b4plNd3ced","name":"Our Love","artist":"bKOn23ea4"},{"id":"xLo0uGaddc0","name":"Slow Jam","artist":"bgoi983dc"},{"id":"cnKGOf1507","name":"Stay With Me","artist":"baT71d676"}],"albums":[{"id":"nRb9e68ef","name":"Love Ballads","artist":"buAEf05dc"},{"id":"fPdW726f7","name":"Heart and Soul","artist":"buAEf05dc"},{"id":"Dh5A495ee","name":"Chris Botti in Boston","artist":"buNofd03a"},{"id":"jeS9d7409","name":"Saxophonic","artist":"buNce61c7"},{"id":"noS2191e7","name":"Kenny G Live","artist":"buAEf05dc"},{"id":"eTOZ6b6ea","name":"Heaven, Earth and Beyond","artist":"bwgYe403b"},{"id":"nsSz2db50","name":"Midnight Drive","artist":"Wqncb23f"},{"id":"4wA13bb2e","name":"Twilight","artist":"b00ufc6ea"},{"id":"eQAz59ab2","name":"Breathless","artist":"buAEf05dc"},{"id":"noSHe5dc3","name":"Rhythm and Romance","artist":"buAEf05dc"},{"id":"9czI5eefe32","name":"Sleepless songs","artist":"8h8yTPfbc99"},{"id":"C1ZY45443","name":"Seduction","artist":"4Lz90ba6"}],"artists":[{"id":"buAEf05dc","name":"Kenny G"},{"id":"Wqncb23f","name":"Tommy Emmanuel"},{"id":"buNofd03a","name":"Chris Botti"},{"id":"buNce61c7","name":"Dave Koz"},{"id":"buMGffb11","name":"Paul Hardcastle"},{"id":"bKOn23ea4","name":"Brian Culbertson"},{"id":"4Lk4e459","name":"Fourplay"},{"id":"2OP57a42","name":"George Benson"},{"id":"bKKK1e6fd","name":"Jim Chappell"},{"id":"buNwef4c0","name":"Candy Dulfer"},{"id":"SYKaa0c7","name":"Lee Ritenour"},{"id":"4Lz90ba6","name":"Boney James"}]},{"type":"style","id":"159","name":"融合爵士 Jazz Fusion","description":"融合爵士兴起于七十年代，是爵士乐的分支之一。只要你有足够的创新意识和胆量，任何音乐都可以成为爵士乐的调料。如今所谓的融合爵士一般是指在爵士乐的基础上融合了摇滚乐、世界音乐等成分，同时也融进一些流行音乐元素的爵士风格。因此，融合爵士给人的感觉是既新鲜又流行，而又不失爵士乐的色彩。\n从乐队上看，融合爵士打破了传统爵士乐队一直以原声乐器为主体的原则，它大量的使用电声乐器和电子乐器，使其更具现代气息。比如用电贝司代替原声贝司，用电子合成器代替钢琴，电吉他使用效果器（传统爵士乐一般不使用使用效果器）等做法都是一次大胆的创新。从节奏形态上看，融合爵士经常加强鼓和贝司的力度，制造出奔腾不息的节奏律动，钢琴和吉他也从原来演奏旋律声部转变为节奏乐器。这种不规则的低音线条，疯狂的贝司击弦，厚重的摇滚节拍加上爵士乐的规则，有时又被称为爵士放克（Jazz Funk）。总之，融合爵士的电气味重了，流行味浓了，因此被人接受的可能度也就大了。\nJazz fusion (also known as fusion) is a musical genre that developed in the late 1960s when musicians combined aspects of jazz harmony and improvisation with styles such as funk, rock, rhythm and blues, and Latin jazz. During this time many jazz musicians began experimenting with electric instruments and amplified sound for the first time, as well as electronic effects and synthesizers. Many of the developments during the late 1960s and early 1970s have since become established elements of jazz fusion musical practice.\nRock and RnB came from jazz in the 1940s via the jump blues genre. Needless to say, over the years jazz, rock and RnB have enjoyed a close relationship and have cross-influenced each other from the beginning. In the mid to late 60s, rock and RnB under went major changes with rock becoming much louder and more experimental under the influence of artists such as Jimi Hendrix and Cream, while RnB became more syncopated and abstract with the new funk sound created by James Brown, Bootsy Collins, Sly Stone and Larry Graham. Meanwhile, Latin jazz was undergoing similar experimental changes under the guidance of artists such as Hermato Pascoal and Flora Purim.\n\nAt this point in the mid to late 60s, any intersection between jazz, rock, funk and Latin became a radically different form of music that eventually came to be called fusion.","songs":[{"id":"Luj466756","name":"The Game of Love","artist":"2Kj8b53e"},{"id":"OOuu845f0","name":"Since We Met","artist":"Wqncb23f"},{"id":"xL5G9Oa251b","name":"サニーサイドメロディー","artist":"FZt17573"},{"id":"gmQjv4975e","name":"For the Love of God","artist":"dQwb49683"},{"id":"b4IaD98aef","name":"Ghost","artist":"cj7p2a1b8"},{"id":"Npnm7c3d7","name":"Bruce Lee","artist":"4KY75bc5"},{"id":"b3gwlcfbda","name":"Live for the Dream","artist":"buMGffb11"},{"id":"MmrJ53959","name":"Crazy Race","artist":"4J7528ae"},{"id":"mQNWOT5bf35","name":"Take Your Time","artist":"OUz8a783"},{"id":"b19src10e8","name":"Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get","artist":"2Yxac6db"},{"id":"8Gamcqeb9a2","name":"怀念","artist":"Hnb69a4d"},{"id":"xLAEBJaeb12","name":"匆匆那年","artist":"xVd4nMbbd1b"}],"albums":[{"id":"nsS01b8cc","name":"Only","artist":"Wqncb23f"},{"id":"jg1da0c68","name":"Colma","artist":"cj7p2a1b8"},{"id":"nsSz2db50","name":"Midnight Drive","artist":"Wqncb23f"},{"id":"bBSsvKO476b5","name":"BRIGHT TIME","artist":"FZt17573"},{"id":"eNxk956c2","name":"The 7th Song: Enchanting Guita...","artist":"dQwb49683"},{"id":"EOP63b45","name":"Shaman","artist":"2Kj8b53e"},{"id":"nsS2e2a5a","name":"The Mystery","artist":"Wqncb23f"},{"id":"EOB95f89","name":"Supernatural","artist":"2Kj8b53e"},{"id":"nqV5fd6df","name":"Silver Rain","artist":"4KY75bc5"},{"id":"eIzABM1fb15","name":"第三个月","artist":"oWeW2d1a6b"},{"id":"dJBNWoe6134","name":"Jazz Day And Night","artist":"xUsHEa11f5e"},{"id":"4QwV36e15","name":"梦境","artist":"Hnb69a4d"}],"artists":[{"id":"gWPc4394","name":"坂本龍一"},{"id":"Wqncb23f","name":"Tommy Emmanuel"},{"id":"SR8dda81","name":"Miles Davis"},{"id":"2Kj8b53e","name":"Santana"},{"id":"SU79f012","name":"Keith Jarrett"},{"id":"dQwb49683","name":"Steve Vai"},{"id":"VWxa7f5f","name":"細野晴臣"},{"id":"4KY75bc5","name":"Marcus Miller"},{"id":"SDCb7410","name":"Jeff Beck"},{"id":"FZt17573","name":"EGO-WRAPPIN'"},{"id":"ciRD27262","name":"Frank Zappa"},{"id":"bsUxf525b","name":"Herbie Hancock"}]},{"type":"style","id":"188","name":"爵士放克 Jazz Funk","description":"放克爵士乐（Jazz funk），是1960年代受放克影响而发展出来的一种爵士乐风格，特色是强列的Backbeat，即兴演奏比重较放克音乐要多，与同时期的融合爵士乐相似使用大量电子乐器、合成器。\nJazz-funk is a subgenre of jazz music characterized by a strong back beat (groove), electrified sounds and an early prevalence of analog synthesizers. The integration of funk, soul, and R&B music and styles into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is quite wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs, and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.\nJazz-funk is primarily an American genre, where it was popular throughout the 1970s and the early 1980s, but it also achieved noted appeal on the club-circuit in England during the mid-1970s. Similar genres include soul jazz and jazz fusion, but neither entirely overlap with jazz-funk. Notably jazz-funk is less vocal, more arranged and featured more improvisation than soul jazz, and retains a strong feel of groove and R&B versus some of the jazz fusion production.\nFunk jazz is a sub-genre of jazz fusion and is basically the blending of funk rhythms with jazz improvisation.

It developed in the UK over the 1980s and 1990s and could be seen as tacking the sound of jazz-funk onto electronic dance: jazz-funk musicians such as Roy Ayers, Donald Byrd and Grant Green are often credited as forerunners of acid jazz. Acid jazz has also experienced minor influences from soul, house, and disco.\nWhile acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition (sometimes including sampling or live DJ cutting and scratching), it is just as likely to be played live by musicians, who often showcase jazz interpretation as part of their performance. The compositions of groups such as Jamiroquai, Galliano, Urban Species, The Brand New Heavies and Incognito often feature chord structures usually associated with jazz music.\nThe acid jazz \"movement\" is also seen as a revival of jazz-funk or jazz fusion or soul jazz by leading DJs such as Norman Jay or Gilles Peterson or Patrick Forge, also known as \"rare groove crate diggers\" or \"Cataroos\".\nQ magazine stated \"Acid jazz was the most significant jazz form to emerge out of the British music scene\".\n\nJazz music community with review and forums\nAcid jazz grew out of the late 80s DJ scene in London in which record spinners would treat dancing patrons to difficult to find 45s released by 60s soul jazz artists. Eventually contemporary lounge/jazz performers such as James Taylor began to capitalize on this interest in 60s 'rare groove' and began to perform live music that had equal appeal for the trendy club crowd. Another aspect of early Acid Jazz involved the mixing of 60s RnB-jazz with the sounds and rhythms of acid house. Once Acid Jazz left England, confusion as to what it actually was created a diversity of influences including dub reggae, hip-hop, drumnbass and 60s psychedelic rock. More recently Acid Jazz is often seen as either 60s rare groove, or a merging of jazz with trip-hop or other club friendly electronica sounds and rhythms.\nTypically the artists listed in JMA's acid jazz genre are live bands while acid jazz artists who are more DJ based are listed in our DJ/Electronica jazz genre.","songs":[{"id":"gozem456c4","name":"Koop Islands Blues","artist":"Wk8dc020"},{"id":"8GaMlVf8a44","name":"Paradise Circus","artist":"TrK152fe"},{"id":"gtROu4481a","name":"The Daydream","artist":"dX8143b88"},{"id":"bAuPpaa223","name":"To Build A Home","artist":"5T48cdd9"},{"id":"b56ikb3729","name":"In the Waiting Line","artist":"72X66b62"},{"id":"N9oA56d48","name":"Santana","artist":"3YG770c4"},{"id":"b19src10e8","name":"Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get","artist":"2Yxac6db"},{"id":"b1IIW113cb","name":"Shadows of Ourselves","artist":"VUVbaad8"},{"id":"xLoZ5Hd967f","name":"Beautiful Night (Album Version)","artist":"9iQ6214b"},{"id":"d74mv2a34d","name":"Drive Time","artist":"XMOc4d50"},{"id":"R24z8862d","name":"Bluebird","artist":"bawY9d4a8"},{"id":"mQ4MO48e944","name":"Too much","artist":"HZB4f5a4"}],"albums":[{"id":"jgvqd914d","name":"Koop Islands","artist":"Wk8dc020"},{"id":"ogO1e53fe","name":"Heligoland","artist":"TrK152fe"},{"id":"jGhiba081","name":"She and He","artist":"dX8143b88"},{"id":"xAwBYO162b2","name":"Soul Beats Bboy Vol.2","artist":"yhbMYid7cfd"},{"id":"ncg0f7a6d","name":"Ma Fleur","artist":"5T48cdd9"},{"id":"jll1988a8","name":"Simple Things","artist":"72X66b62"},{"id":"iPPM11575","name":"The Mirror Conspiracy","artist":"VUVbaad8"},{"id":"nZKmf91c2","name":"High Times Singles 1992-2006","artist":"TBw153a8"},{"id":"nyoweb117","name":"Nocturnal","artist":"XMOc4d50"},{"id":"iWEWc3d6c","name":"Rooftop Soundcheck","artist":"3YG770c4"},{"id":"eZWu780c1","name":"En Route","artist":"XMOc4d50"},{"id":"Kqb75a90","name":"Up All Night","artist":"2Yxac6db"}],"artists":[{"id":"cKig2d251","name":"Sia"},{"id":"bwv6fe54f","name":"東京事変"},{"id":"Wk8dc020","name":"Koop"},{"id":"TBw153a8","name":"Jamiroquai"},{"id":"4bW630c4","name":"Moloko"},{"id":"VUVbaad8","name":"Thievery Corporation"},{"id":"eeCI4681d","name":"Tape Five"},{"id":"b7bZ16dc2","name":"Peter Malick"},{"id":"nmSssm58f2f","name":"小老虎&Soulspeak"},{"id":"3Y8ea2eb","name":"Incognito"},{"id":"bjEe9cdfd","name":"Ceezy"},{"id":"XMOc4d50","name":"Four80East"}]},{"type":"style","id":"197","name":"非洲爵士 African Jazz","description":"African Jazz是南非的爵士音乐，结合了非洲狂放的节奏，在美国，非洲爵士的形成深受黑人音乐风格的影响。 第一次世界大战之后，一支来自美国新奥尔良的迪克西兰乐队给南非带来爵士的第一缕声响。在此期间，昆斯敦成为南非爵士乐发展的要点。As in the United States, South African jazz was strongly influenced by the music styles of the black population.

Later the Jazz Maniacs entered the scene and mixed influences from Marabi music to Duke Ellington.","songs":[{"id":"mQONGJ54b3e","name":"Pay An Ké","artist":"m0bNv28eadb"},{"id":"xLymj513d5f","name":"Pape Ndiaye","artist":"dveC381ee"},{"id":"U5Aset284bb","name":"Soul Makossa","artist":"c9sq30194"},{"id":"b12GD9e4e3","name":"Mandela (Bring Him Back Home!)","artist":"2Vm82c76"},{"id":"8G0Zmefc223","name":"▼SURFING WITH YOUR MAMA / / / 母さんと波乗り▼","artist":"bt7ujs81ca9"},{"id":"N1tD648bb","name":"Damara Blue","artist":"bsVoeb7a8"},{"id":"cU0ke23219","name":"Twice as Sad","artist":"BW7b1389"},{"id":"NYKT89ba0","name":"You Ain't Gonna Know Me 'Cos You Think You Know Me","artist":"UR0a6ec2"},{"id":"Mt9s82272","name":"Africanos/ Latinos","artist":"4JO75712"},{"id":"LdXy9c997","name":"Devotion","artist":"2Xy7e09e"},{"id":"b52T5aafb5","name":"Moshi","artist":"7wu65ef1"}],"albums":[{"id":"bFhHf594f","name":"Soul Makossa","artist":"c9sq30194"},{"id":"bMeSPn95f73","name":"7ème Ciel","artist":"m0bNv28eadb"},{"id":"Jau93d1c","name":"Hope","artist":"2Vm82c76"},{"id":"g3hB62acf","name":"Made in Dakar","artist":"dveC381ee"},{"id":"Jas74e1c","name":"Uptownship","artist":"2Vm82c76"},{"id":"b8kne3c4e","name":"Cape Town Revisited","artist":"bsVoeb7a8"},{"id":"nmT4s091bac","name":"▼SURFING WITH YOUR MAMA // 母さん...","artist":"bt7ujs81ca9"},{"id":"jexVc5b4c","name":"Africa N'Da Blues","artist":"4JO75712"},{"id":"PfW8373f","name":"Makossa Man","artist":"c9sq30194"},{"id":"eSF9d3942","name":"Our Songs","artist":"nnATig5739d"},{"id":"gi8155347","name":"Specialist In All Styles","artist":"dveC381ee"},{"id":"fsNB66a93","name":"Prietos","artist":"BW7b1389"}],"artists":[{"id":"SY5bf9b3","name":"Sun Ra"},{"id":"btcPe8219","name":"World Saxophone Quartet"},{"id":"bsVoeb7a8","name":"Abdullah Ibrahim"},{"id":"2Vm82c76","name":"Hugh Masekela"},{"id":"c9sq30194","name":"Manu Dibango"},{"id":"BW7b1389","name":"Omar Sosa"},{"id":"4JO75712","name":"Kahil El'Zabar"},{"id":"baR7c053e","name":"Trevor Watts"},{"id":"UR0a6ec2","name":"Louis Moholo"},{"id":"dveC381ee","name":"Orchestra Baobab"},{"id":"3aD8002f","name":"Randy Weston"},{"id":"2Xy7e09e","name":"Courtney Pine"}]},{"type":"style","id":"193","name":"非洲古巴爵士 Afro-Cuban Jazz","description":"古巴爵士（Afro-Cuban Jazz），也叫非洲古巴爵士，它被认为是拉丁爵士的发端，也深深影响了拉丁爵士的发展。非裔古巴的打击乐，融合进了爵士乐的特色，再加入点波普和摇摆乐、放克，便形成了独一无二的古巴爵士。古巴爵士承袭了古巴音乐微妙宁静和强而有力的双重品格，轻佻又不失轻柔。古巴爵士偏重于打击乐器和旋律，康加鼓Conga、沙槌Maracas、三弦吉他Tres等富有古巴特色的乐器，与传统管弦乐器交相呼应。拉丁美洲人民天生活泼喜悦，有属于自己的节奏律动，这种律动也是古巴爵士最重要的节奏模式，它叫Clave Rhythm。由于节奏和旋律都非常活泼跳跃，因此你听古巴爵士，会情不自禁跟着摇摆起来，无拘无束的音乐氛围令人陶醉其中。古巴爵士诞生于20世纪40年代早期（另一种说法是20至30年代），它的形成，归功于Mario Bauzá（马里奥·鲍扎）、Machito（马奇托）、Dizzy Gillespie（吉尔斯比）、Chano Pozo（加诺·波佐）这几位艺术家不懈的努力与推动。\n可以毫不夸张地说，古巴爵士之于古巴，就如同巴萨诺瓦之于巴西一样，它俨然成为了古巴最重要的文化遗产之一。\n非洲古巴爵士，将来自于古巴和非洲的节奏与爵士乐的即兴创作结合在一起的爵士乐类型。它也被人们称为拉丁爵士(Latin Jazz).但一些演奏者还是更喜欢用“非洲古巴爵士”这个词。古巴爵士有时也被称作为非洲古巴爵士，在所有后-摇摆乐的形式中，古巴爵士向来最受青睐。原因很简单：它对于打击乐器和古巴旋律的偏重，使得这一音乐形式相当合适跳舞，且易于理解。\n20世纪20-30年代，有个别的爵士音乐家在他们的音乐中运用南美洲的节奏和拉丁流行乐元素。促使这种音乐产生的人是马里奥·鲍扎（Mario Bauza)，他是一位小号手兼编曲家。他把小号大师吉尔斯比（Dizzy Gillespie）介绍给了古巴打击乐大师加诺·波佐(Chano Pozo)。两人在1947年—1948年间共同创作了不少新颖的音乐，直到波佐去世。也正在是鲍扎的介绍下，拉丁乐队领袖马奇托（Machito)才是开始使用独奏爵士乐手。\n20世纪40年代末，斯坦肯顿（Stan Kenton)开始在他的音乐里结合拉丁节奏。\n20世纪50年代，这股风气开始盛行，“非洲古巴爵士”成为最流行的爵士风格之一。\n近代的一些乐队在非洲古巴爵士的波普(Bop)根源基础之上加入疯克（Funk）元素并引入更多的独奏。这种音乐的精髓就是北美、南美、和中美的真正融合。重点就是具有感染力的节奏。\n\nAfro-Cuban Jazz is a combination of jazz improvising and rhythms from Cuba and Africa; it is also known as Latin jazz. There were some hints of Afro-Cuban jazz in isolated cases during the 1920s and '30s — Jelly Roll Morton's \"Spanish tinge\" in some of his more rhythmic piano solos, a few Gene Krupa performances where he sought to include South American rhythms, and even in the Latin pop music of Xavier Cugat. However, the true birth of Afro-Cuban jazz can be traced to trumpeter-arranger Mario Bauza. Bauza introduced trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie to the masterful Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo (they teamed up in 1947-48 to create innovative music before Pozo's death) and also persuaded Latin bandleader Machito to use jazz soloists. During the late '40s, Stan Kenton began to integrate Latin rhythms in his music, and with the rising popularity of Tito Puente and Cal Tjader during the 1950s, Afro-Cuban jazz caught on as one of the most popular jazz styles. In more recent times some groups have developed Afro-Cuban jazz beyond its boppish roots, performing Thelonius Monk and John Coltrane tunes, adding funk to the mixture, and having more adventurous solos. The spirit of the music — a true fusion between North, South, and Central America — and an emphasis on infectious rhythms are the keys. — Scott Yanow\nAfro-Cuban Jazz combines traditional African based rhythms from Cuba with the pyrotechnical solos of jazz or fusion. This genre got its start when Mario Bauza introduced bop trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie to Cuban percussionist Chano Pozo. The two made exciting new music together starting in 1947 and ending abruptly in 1948 when Pozo passed away. About this same time Cuban bandleader Machito began to feature jazzy solos in his band arrangements. With the rise of artists such as Tito Puente, Afro-Cuban jazz became one of the most popular styles of jazz in the 1950s.\n\nAfro-Cuban is still one of the more popular styles of jazz today and continues to grow and evolve as it takes on influences from fusion and even the avant-garde.

It originated in the 1950s and developed through the 1960s. Originally synonymous with free jazz, much avant-garde jazz was distinct from that style.\nThe Avant-garde Jazz genre at JMA generally consists of jazz that is usually atonal, and quite often a-rhythmic as well. Avant-garde jazz can be ‘free’, in that there is no prescribed structure for the musicians to follow, or there may be some sort of compositional structure being used as well. Other factors that can result in an avant-garde tag include the use of extremes, such as extremely loud music, or extremely quiet music etc. Also, experimental presentations can be considered, such as a piece where the performers are playing without being able to hear each other, or all of the musicians are submerged in water, etc. Generally the Avant-garde Jazz genre is reserved for musicians from a jazz background, but JMA also includes some non-jazz avant-garde musicians in our Jazz Related Improvisation/Composition genre.","songs":[{"id":"b1wlRd47a3","name":"Old Melodie","artist":"VDfaaf4d"},{"id":"KLY2b899e","name":"Les Feuilles Mortes","artist":"2YE5962d"},{"id":"b9SaPc268e","name":"Sunday Song","artist":"bepha9e9b"},{"id":"xNJuXv1080f","name":"Howie Lee & Fishdoll - 慢化无","artist":"yiunE3a886e"},{"id":"Tg4p66602","name":"Goodbye","artist":"bcRfddab5"},{"id":"b2u3La15c7","name":"A Love Supreme, Pt. 1: Acknowledgement","artist":"bsSde9eae"},{"id":"chanh198d1","name":"You Are So Beautiful","artist":"2UM4d0a2"},{"id":"cUAwC334de","name":"Seven/Somewhere I Have Travelled, Gladly Beyond","artist":"Cnx7b1ff"},{"id":"mQ5O1s58066","name":"Take 1","artist":"2ZO4d809"},{"id":"K74Sc6617","name":"Soft Blue","artist":"bsXu1a078"},{"id":"ckilze755d","name":"Les Jardins de Ziryab","artist":"UOEce2fc"},{"id":"cjh1cf27da","name":"Conference of the Birds","artist":"dyZ43db76"}],"albums":[{"id":"v4pm28c15","name":"Stepmother City","artist":"VDfaaf4d"},{"id":"4Dls3703f","name":"Hubris","artist":"bepha9e9b"},{"id":"bk0idffe9","name":"French Ballads","artist":"2YE5962d"},{"id":"44LQ357a7","name":"April","artist":"Cnx7b1ff"},{"id":"yhUvU2baee7","name":"慢化无／飞夜种","artist":"JNP69039"},{"id":"dmAv35065","name":"A   Love Supreme","artist":"bsSde9eae"},{"id":"jfJVa466b","name":"Le  Voyage de Sahar","artist":"UOEce2fc"},{"id":"fwDV9184d","name":"Goodbye","artist":"bcRfddab5"},{"id":"fxDF56fa5","name":"Juan Condori","artist":"cJjh2e3d6"},{"id":"yhErtk1338a","name":"About JazzHiphop process","artist":"bqH0nsc359f3"},{"id":"b8Qtf3bf4","name":"Lift Every Voice","artist":"2UM4d0a2"},{"id":"bVD4383cf","name":"Ballads","artist":"SP1b0ec9"}],"artists":[{"id":"bsSde9eae","name":"John Coltrane"},{"id":"bITe23196","name":"Chick Corea"},{"id":"bVuf1e9ec","name":"阿部薫"},{"id":"2VO78d4f","name":"Charles Mingus"},{"id":"SY5bf9b3","name":"Sun Ra"},{"id":"80p6e4c4","name":"나윤선"},{"id":"2YE5962d","name":"Archie Shepp"},{"id":"SZl9d11a","name":"Pharoah Sanders"},{"id":"bISF2561c","name":"Don Cherry"},{"id":"UPoa7faa","name":"近藤等則"},{"id":"SRRadfc6","name":"Eric Dolphy"},{"id":"dyZ43db76","name":"Dave Holland"}]},{"type":"style","id":"134","name":"大乐队 Big Band","description":"又译大乐队或大乐队时代，是演奏爵士乐的乐团，流行于美国30年代初到50年代末的摇摆年代(Swing Era)。大乐团的编制通常有10到25位乐手，包括演奏萨克斯风、小喇叭、伸缩喇叭、铁琴的乐手，还有歌手以及负责节奏乐器的乐手。20年代末期出现的新型大乐队有更多即兴的成分。但这类型的爵士乐不若为跳舞而演奏的爵士乐来得受欢迎，期间只有少数音乐被录制成唱片，所制成的唱片被称为‘民族唱片’(Race records)，听众也只限于少数的都市人口，且只有极少数的白人乐手熟悉这类曲风。这类曲风主要在纽约市、芝加哥、堪萨斯市发展。\nA Big Band is a type of musical ensemble that usually consists of ten or more musicians with four sections: saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. Big bands originated during the early 1910s and dominated jazz in the early 1940s when swing was most popular. The term \"big band\" is also used to describe a genre of music. One problem with this usage is that it overlooks the variety of music played by these bands.\nBig bands started as accompaniment for dancing. In contrast with the emphasis on improvisation, big bands relied on written compositions and arrangements. They gave a greater role to bandleaders, arrangers, and sections of instruments rather than soloists.\nThe Big Band genre at JMA is for large ensembles (generally ten or more musicians) who play in what best can be called a \"big band style\". The big band style involves breaking the large ensemble into separate sections, usually grouped by instrument, that then engage in call and response type figures with each other. These motifs can be arranged or improvised. The big band arranging style can also use repeating interlocking riffs by the various sections that provide a rhythmic groove for soloists. Early innovators in big band music include Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Benny Goodman. Modern big band leaders include Quincy Jones and Maynard Ferguson.\nThe Big Band genre at JMA also includes jazz influenced pop orchetra leaders such as Paul Whiteman, Glen Miller and the Dorsey Brothers. Modern big bands that are influenced by avant-garde music, 3rd stream music or other types of modern elements can be found in the Progressive Big Band genre.","songs":[{"id":"fB3dj403e6","name":"A Morning in Cornwall","artist":"AKw86a89"},{"id":"8GfS24172d5","name":"Better Off Dead","artist":"C7z8311e"},{"id":"dBxk2279c6","name":"Heal the World","artist":"DAF8c28f"},{"id":"chePGf7912","name":"I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)","artist":"bsTQe2ca5"},{"id":"b2OXba33fb","name":"Ida!

Young和Coleman hawkins.\n\nBebop or bop is a style of jazz developed in the early to mid-1940s in the United States, which features songs characterized by a fast tempo, complex chord progressions with rapid chord changes and numerous changes of key, instrumental virtuosity, and improvisation based on a combination of harmonic structure, the use of scales and occasional references to the melody.\n\nBebop developed as the younger generation of jazz musicians expanded the creative possibilities of jazz beyond the popular, dance-oriented swing style with a new \"musician's music\" that was not as danceable and demanded close listening. As bebop was not intended for dancing, it enabled the musicians to play at faster tempos. Bebop musicians explored advanced harmonies, complex syncopation, altered chords, extended chords, chord substitutions, asymmetrical phrasing, and intricate melodies. Bebop groups used rhythm sections in a way that expanded their role. Whereas the key ensemble of the swing era was the big band of up to fourteen pieces playing in an ensemble-based style, the classic bebop group was a small combo that consisted of saxophone (alto or tenor), trumpet, piano, double bass, and drums playing music in which the ensemble played a supportive role for soloists. Rather than play heavily arranged music, bebop musicians typically played the melody of a song (called the \"head\") with the accompaniment of the rhythm section, followed by a section in which each of the performers improvised a solo, then returned to the melody at the end of the song.\n\nBop, or be-bop in its full name, was a young jazz man's answer to the more conservative prevailingly swing music of the time. Developed in New York City during the early 40s, bop hit the international scene in 1945 and took everyone by surprise with its energetic and radical approach to swing jazz music. In the hands of innovators such as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Bud Powell, the old swing music was given much faster tempos and more spare accompaniments from the rhythm section which opened up space for rapid fire pyrotechnical solos. Still a favorite genre in jazz music schools around the world, many clubs still feature be-bop to this day, but today's bop sounds tamer and calmer than the original item.","songs":[{"id":"KDrC4e1c4","name":"Everything Happens to Me","artist":"SUVb11a4"},{"id":"ejDiS4e708","name":"But Beautiful","artist":"SW41334c"},{"id":"b0zvs13a09","name":"Prisoner of Love","artist":"ciWw2622e"},{"id":"xLozS3ca9ec","name":"Autumn in New York","artist":"SSXb4a77"},{"id":"ciJbo1a020","name":"Acércate Más","artist":"bsSUf179d"},{"id":"KGgw5e6a4","name":"The Things We Did Last Summer","artist":"2YC6ecb3"},{"id":"b2ANad6421","name":"You Look Good to Me","artist":"SYmdced6"},{"id":"gmrTo46944","name":"Learnin' the Blues","artist":"bbwccb0a4"},{"id":"MyNr7427e","name":"My Romance","artist":"SXXdb1b0"},{"id":"LeQt83bc3","name":"Misty","artist":"2RQ58eb4"},{"id":"cgQkWf475d","name":"(I Wonder) Where Our Love Has Gone","artist":"cZem3b20a"},{"id":"b3SIAcb3ac","name":"Zamar Nodad","artist":"bsWSe361a"}],"albums":[{"id":"I1a8b82c","name":"Flight to Denmark","artist":"SUVb11a4"},{"id":"fhMr6678c","name":"Steve Allen Plays Jazz Tonight","artist":"yiuiBoaad72"},{"id":"bjwca924d","name":"Solo Monk","artist":"SWV1320c"},{"id":"bjlsb1388","name":"Beautiful","artist":"SW41334c"},{"id":"bjHB9e7ab","name":"Unforgettable","artist":"SXXdb1b0"},{"id":"b9Po1c8dd","name":"We Get Requests","artist":"SYmdced6"},{"id":"bjNOc71ac","name":"A   Jazz Portrait of Frank Sin...","artist":"bbwccb0a4"},{"id":"HNJ81d23","name":"Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben...","artist":"ciWw2622e"},{"id":"bjDMd4688","name":"Charlie Parker","artist":"SXQd6369"},{"id":"GTY63d29","name":"100 Years of Latin Love Songs","artist":"bsSUf179d"},{"id":"cbuA3b80f","name":"South of the Border, West of t...","artist":"3aP7f05f"},{"id":"Kwy95e6b","name":"The Swingin's Mutual!","artist":"2YC6ecb3"}],"artists":[{"id":"cYWX3bd36","name":"Ella Fitzgerald"},{"id":"SR8dda81","name":"Miles Davis"},{"id":"SXQd6369","name":"Charlie Parker"},{"id":"3ad723c0","name":"Sarah Vaughan"},{"id":"SWV1320c","name":"Thelonious Monk"},{"id":"SYmdced6","name":"Oscar Peterson"},{"id":"btbwf485a","name":"Toots Thielemans"},{"id":"dyYo3d170","name":"Dizzy Gillespie"},{"id":"2OZ90474","name":"Art Blakey"},{"id":"SXXdb1b0","name":"Joe Pass"},{"id":"2XZ6b4f7","name":"Sonny Rollins"},{"id":"bsZCf0328","name":"Buddy Rich"}]},{"type":"style","id":"149","name":"室内爵士 Chamber Jazz","description":"室内爵士是爵士乐流派的一种，深受新古典主义音乐与西洋音乐的古典形态影响，在有些国家也是受到传统凯尔特音乐，欧洲民间音乐，拉美音乐的影响而成型。\n\nChamber Jazz is distinguished by small, acoustic-based ensembles in which improvisation is a major factor.

Jazz","description":"酷爵士乐(CoolJazz)一般而言指1949-1950年间，由小喇叭手迈尔士戴维斯(MilesDavis)所领导的九重奏为Capitol唱片公司灌录的专辑《BirthoftheCool》所代表的乐风，它的诞生使主流爵士乐风，从咆哮乐风的\"热\"，转向另一个反方向酷派乐风的\"冷\"，这是一种180度大逆转的历史性发展。酷派爵士乐代表一种内敛自省的情感，它是一种轻柔、清凉与抒情的含蓄情愫；它的音色不如一般铜管器那样亮丽夺目，取而代之的是柔和优美。若说咆哮乐是代表热情奔放，那么酷派爵士乐就是内敛自省。简而言之，酷派爵士乐是对咆哮乐的反抗与检讨，同时也唤醒美国西岸一些白人乐手的自觉运动，形成一股新兴的爵士乐潮流-西岸酷派爵士乐(WestCoastCoolJazz)。而酷派爵士最著名的作品，即是迈尔士戴维斯五重奏的「KINDOFBLUE」。因为这种乐风常被美国西海岸乐手使用，所以Cool Jazz也被称为西岸爵士乐(West Coast Jazz)，它可以说恰好是相对于比波普的风格而存在，相对于比波普的快速节拍、复杂的旋律、和弦、曲调，Cool Jazz会轻松很多。\n\n1950年，Miles Davis九人小组推出的专辑《The Birth of The Cool》，标志着Cool爵士的产生。\n\nCool爵士选用的音调是轻柔的、淡雅的，音质柔和干爽。独奏中，带给你一种柔和舒缓、克制的感觉。其重奏部分微妙深奥，有时让你联想起欧州经典室内乐。Cool爵士虽然也揉进了Bop的音调、旋律与和声的优势，但是比Bop的即兴演奏更舒缓平滑，音色更加和谐，与Bop相比，Cool爵士乐经常突出体现一种松弛感，而没有Bop那么强的内在张力。\n\nCool爵士鼓手也更加安静，不干扰其他音色，总而言之，Cool爵士风格是节制的，“点到为止”，这正是为什么其乐迷称之为“Cool”的原因。\n\nCool jazz is a style of modern jazz music that arose in the United States after World War II. It is characterized by relaxed tempos and lighter tone, in contrast to the fast and complex bebop style. Cool jazz often employs formal arrangements and incorporates elements of classical music. Broadly, the genre refers to a number of post-war jazz styles employing a more subdued approach than that found in other contemporaneous jazz idioms. As Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill suggest \"the tonal sonorities of these conservative players could be compared to pastel colors, while the solos of [Dizzy] Gillespie and his followers could be compared to fiery red colors.\"\nCool Jazz evolved directly from bop in the late '40s and '50s. Essentially, it was a mixture of bop with certain aspects of swing that had been overlooked or temporarily discarded. Dissonances were smoothed out, tones were softened, arrangements became important again, and the rhythm section's accents were less jarring. Because some of the key pacesetters of the style (many of whom were studio musicians) were centered in Los Angeles, it was nicknamed \"West Coast jazz.\" Some of the recordings were experimental in nature (hinting at classical music) and some overarranged sessions were bland, but in general this was a viable and popular style. By the late '50s, hard bop from the East Coast had succeeded cool jazz, although many of the style's top players had long and productive careers. Among the many top artists who were important in the development of cool jazz were Lester Young,Miles Davis, Gerry Mulligan, Stan Getz, Shorty Rogers, and Howard Rumsey (leader of the Lighthouse All-Stars). -- Scott Yanow\nCool jazz arose slowly in the late 40s when many jazz musicians realised there was no point in following in the fast paced be-bop footsteps of Diz and Bird and began to try a more relaxed and quieter approach to playing. Early examples of cool jazz came from Miles Davis' Nonet and Lenny Tristano's group, while later practitioners like Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker showed up on the west coast where cool jazz was often referred to as west coast jazz. \n\nMany cool jazz saxophonists looked to the pre-bop languid sax style of Lester Young for inspiration. Also, 3rd Stream influenced arrangements that featured Baroque style counterpoint became popular during the cool era. One lasting innovation of the cool genre is the idea of concert hall influenced 'chamber jazz' as pioneered by The Modern Jazz Quartet. For some critics, west coast jazz seemed like a souless sell-out compared to the more challenging and urban flavored be-bop of New York City. In 1952 Miles Davis was one of the first 'cool' band leaders to lead the way to a more aggressive next phase in jazz, hard bop.\n\nCool jazz began to fade before the arrival of fusion and never made a comeback afterwards. Today Cool Jazz is a retro style that defines a certain time and place in jazz history, but is still played by some.","songs":[{"id":"b0U1ybfdb8","name":"I Fall in Love Too Easily","artist":"SP3dae8b"},{"id":"PJtkd95d0","name":"I'm in the Mood for Love","artist":"bxUcf513b"},{"id":"K30E53020","name":"Flamenco Sketches","artist":"SR8dda81"},{"id":"mQ59827f793","name":"Where Can I Go Without You","artist":"SU79f012"},{"id":"b2iD5cf311","name":"Dream a Little Dream","artist":"SXob7797"},{"id":"M3XK68842","name":"Samba Cantina","artist":"2QN5a89d"},{"id":"KGgw5e6a4","name":"The Things We Did Last Summer","artist":"2YC6ecb3"},{"id":"QDk550a04","name":"Everybody's Cryin' Mercy","artist":"Zlmbc818"},{"id":"b5NaQcd92b","name":"Chambre Avec Vue","artist":"8csc0106"},{"id":"Rta4e06c9","name":"When I Fall in Love","artist":"Aiv8c16b"},{"id":"cg6hzeb761","name":"Ne Me Quitte Pas","artist":"btbwf485a"},{"id":"b3SIAcb3ac","name":"Zamar Nodad","artist":"bsWSe361a"}],"albums":[{"id":"bVEp22248","name":"Chet Baker Sings","artist":"SP3dae8b"},{"id":"bfCrd044b","name":"My Funny Valentine","artist":"SP3dae8b"},{"id":"jmBVd4296","name":"Julie Is Her Name, Vol. 1","artist":"bxUcf513b"},{"id":"bgHrb6d1b","name":"Kind of Blue","artist":"SR8dda81"},{"id":"jmCmb78f3","name":"The End of the World","artist":"bxUcf513b"},{"id":"bfD6996ef","name":"Diane: Chet Baker and Paul Ble...","artist":"SP3dae8b"},{"id":"jwI4d17d0","name":"Portrait in Jazz","artist":"Aiv8c16b"},{"id":"fMDG4b54b","name":"Jasmine","artist":"SU79f012"},{"id":"c0QT25ac1","name":"Chez Toots","artist":"btbwf485a"},{"id":"jGene0fe6","name":"Let's Get Lost","artist":"SP3dae8b"},{"id":"nXxwf822e","name":"The Best of Chet Baker Sings","artist":"SP3dae8b"},{"id":"nyLie938d","name":"Around Midnight","artist":"bxUcf513b"}],"artists":[{"id":"SP3dae8b","name":"Chet Baker"},{"id":"SR8dda81","name":"Miles Davis"},{"id":"cANh333f6","name":"John Barry"},{"id":"c8VR3359f","name":"Bill Evans"},{"id":"bxUcf513b","name":"Julie London"},{"id":"bsTGfec82","name":"Stan Getz"},{"id":"3ad723c0","name":"Sarah Vaughan"},{"id":"2QN5a89d","name":"Paul Desmond"},{"id":"dOWH49aff","name":"Dave Brubeck"},{"id":"Aiv8c16b","name":"Bill Evans Trio"},{"id":"2S3e9103","name":"Jim Hall"},{"id":"TbYd73af","name":"Lester Young"}]},{"type":"style","id":"179","name":"迪克西兰爵士 Dixieland","description":"迪克西兰爵士乐是1917年到1923年在新奥尔良和芝加哥等地的爵士乐手发展出来的早期爵士乐风，它在30年代后期曾被一群拥护者重新找出来复兴一阵子。简单的说，迪克西兰爵士乐是新奥尔良传统爵士乐的一个分支，Dixieland的英文原意是军队露营之地——“Dixie's Land”。这个字第一次出现在1859年Dan Emmett 先生的“殖民地歌曲与舞蹈”歌册中，因此，我们可以得知：迪克西兰爵士乐与进行曲、江湖卖唱艺人（Minstrels）等音乐有关，其第一首知名曲子是1860年出版的“Pocahontas”。到了1910年代，吹这种风格的爵士乐队己被衍化为小型团体，取材大半来自蓝调、进行曲与当时的流行歌曲，甚至某首乐曲的某一小段（Rags）都可以被拿来加以延伸、推展，这是即兴演奏的滥觞。迪克西兰爵士乐的主旋律一般都由小喇叭、竖笛或伸缩喇叭担任，而伴奏乐器是以钢琴、吉他、斑鸠琴、土巴号、贝斯或鼓为主。\nDixieland, sometimes referred to as hot jazz or traditional jazz, is a style of jazz based on the music that developed in New Orleans at the start of the 20th century.\n\nOne of the first uses of the term \"Dixieland\" with reference to music was in the name of the Original Dixieland Jass Band (which shortly thereafter changed the spelling of its name to \"Original Dixieland Jazz Band\"). Their 1917 recordings fostered popular awareness of this new style of music. At that time, there was no issue of subgenres of jazz, so \"Dixieland\" referred to the band and not the music. A revival movement for traditional jazz, formed in reaction to the orchestrated sounds of the swing era and the perceived chaos of the new bebop sounds of the 1940s (referred to as \"Chinese music\" by Louis Armstrong[citation needed]), pulled \"Dixieland\" out from the somewhat forgotten band's name for the music they championed. The revival movement included elements of the Chicago style that developed during the 1920s, such as the use of a string bass instead of a tuba, and chordal instruments, in addition to the original format of the New Orleans style. That reflected the fact that virtually all of the recorded repertoire of New Orleans musicians was from the period when the format was already evolving beyond the traditional New Orleans format. \"Dixieland\" may in that sense be regarded as denoting the jazz revival movement of the late 1930s to the 1950s as much as any particular subgenre of jazz. The essential elements that were accepted as within the style were the traditional front lines consisting of trumpets, trombones, and clarinets, and ensemble improvisation over a 2-beat rhythm.\nDixieland started as a continuation of the original New Orleans jazz tradition (see New Orleans Jazz genre), but in a different locale and under different circumstances. During the early 1920s, many New Orleans musicians drifted up to Chicago seeking work where they continued their musical traditions, but no longer as marching bands. The more stationary aspect of these bands led to the addition of the piano to the band, while the stand up bass replaced the tuba.\n\nThe music also began to evolve as the musicians began to play with a faster more aggressive feel, and the rhythm section began to accent the 2 and 4 of the beat which led to the driving accented rhythms of RnB and rock-n-roll. Dixieland has had many revivals over the years, sometimes authentic and sometimes corny and amateur. To this day you can still find bands all over the world that play this traditional form of jazz.","songs":[{"id":"mQ6H0C94106","name":"Autumn Leaves","artist":"SEIbc3e7"},{"id":"xL2T9ba1afd","name":"Autumn Leaves","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"b22Hib0a22","name":"Evenin'","artist":"2Xm701ee"},{"id":"cgzByf7973","name":"Black and Blue","artist":"c8Vo33145"},{"id":"mQ5Kkh4b93d","name":"I Can't Get Started","artist":"2OI54404"},{"id":"eQW1Y36d88","name":"Sing, Sing, Sing","artist":"VyPc5b62"},{"id":"cijLkf2043","name":"Stardust","artist":"bsRKfb2eb"},{"id":"b1aOCf2fb6","name":"Disenchanted Tour","artist":"c8Wk2f1a3"},{"id":"xLuRp3a1400","name":"All You're Going to Want to Do Is Get Back There","artist":"dL1u410f3"},{"id":"mQCQjs6c68b","name":"I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan (Schwartz-Dietz)","artist":"STtb2b2c"},{"id":"b1dOLab797","name":"Dr. Jazz","artist":"bsZs1d19d"},{"id":"ckkAXed54e","name":"Basin Street Blues","artist":"Ta011e66"}],"albums":[{"id":"fS8b56430","name":"Clapton","artist":"SEIbc3e7"},{"id":"kw1sa56b6","name":"Gold","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"t37Yid9645","name":"Live at the 1958 Monterey Jazz...","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"b5MIf917b","name":"Parisian Encounter","artist":"2OI54404"},{"id":"o8nAe5392","name":"An Empty Bliss Beyond This Wor...","artist":"dL1u410f3"},{"id":"bgJub1f6a","name":"The Jazz Giants","artist":"c8Vo33145"},{"id":"kupldfe80","name":"Butter & Eggman","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"bjKv9d2ac","name":"The Natural Touch","artist":"2Xm701ee"},{"id":"msBjSh923fe","name":"The Centennial Anthology","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"biyJc1505","name":"Swingin' on Broadway","artist":"SUOc7417"},{"id":"cvAS2c35a","name":"Satchmo Serenades","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"bjUzc23fc","name":"Songs of New Orleans","artist":"bsZs1d19d"}],"artists":[{"id":"SPub7bf6","name":"Louis Armstrong"},{"id":"2OI54404","name":"Sidney Bechet"},{"id":"SXiaa8a9","name":"Ferd 'Jelly Roll' Morton"},{"id":"ciXX26476","name":"Steve Lacy"},{"id":"bsZs1d19d","name":"Preservation Hall Jazz Band"},{"id":"2Xm701ee","name":"Ken Peplowski"},{"id":"7Cp6c2cb","name":"Jeff Healey"},{"id":"SVndc225","name":"Gene Krupa"},{"id":"Ta011e66","name":"Jack Teagarden"},{"id":"2Qr4cfa9","name":"Eddie Condon"},{"id":"c8Vo33145","name":"Wild Bill Davison"},{"id":"SXIb1e73","name":"Original Dixieland Jazz Band"}]},{"type":"style","id":"143","name":"实验大乐队 Experimental Big Band","description":"早在六十年代，实验性大乐队开始融入自由爵士乐和即兴创作的元素，并在较小的先锋乐团和古典作曲家的作品的推动下，在接下来的几十年中扩大了他们的范围，尝试无固定调性的音乐，不和谐和日益复杂结构。从像Sun Ra Arkestra和Carla Bley这样的大乐队这样的团体开始，到Little Huey创作音乐管弦乐队的全面混乱，实验大乐队在大型团体编制中产生了惊人的多样化声音。\n\nExperimental big bands began to incorporate elements of free jazz and improvisation as early as the '60s, and fueled by the work of smaller avant-garde ensembles and classical composers, increased their scope in the following decades to embrace atonal music, discordance and increasingly complex structures.

Free Jazz was a radical departure from past styles, for typically after playing a quick theme, the soloist does not have to follow any progression or structure and can go in any unpredictable direction. When Ornette Coleman largely introduced free jazz to New York audiences (although Cecil Taylor had preceded him with less publicity), many bop musicians and fans debated about whether what was being played would even qualify as music; the radicals had become conservatives in less than 15 years. Free jazz, which overlaps with the avant garde (the latter can use arrangements and sometimes fairly tight frameworks), remains a controversial and mostly underground style, influencing the modern mainstream while often being ignored. Having dispensed with many of the rules as far as pitch, rhythm, and development are concerned (although it need not be atonal or lack a steady pulse to be free jazz), the success of a free jazz performance can be measured by the musicianship and imagination of the performers, how colorful the music is, and whether it seems logical or merely random.","songs":[{"id":"mQLIxt5a0f0","name":"50 Ways To Leave Your Lover","artist":"mSTcmG87e4e"},{"id":"b1wkkb6174","name":"Naked Spirit","artist":"VDfaaf4d"},{"id":"b2u3La15c7","name":"A Love Supreme, Pt. 1: Acknowledgement","artist":"bsSde9eae"},{"id":"b13vydcc52","name":"Save Our Children","artist":"SZl9d11a"},{"id":"mQM3nd7a422","name":"Open See","artist":"bi4Ib23a7"},{"id":"bf00nBp2fd44","name":"Oh My Love","artist":"Bjp71014"},{"id":"cjh1cf27da","name":"Conference of the Birds","artist":"dyZ43db76"},{"id":"d38gQ25b52","name":"Porgy","artist":"SPXc37bb"},{"id":"MoLz71f2e","name":"By Any Means Necessary","artist":"4JF764ff"},{"id":"xLpzzhb5296","name":"At Home","artist":"b76sf446e"},{"id":"b2AVOd3eac","name":"Mrs. Parker of K.C.

Because its origins are in France and Django was from the Manouche Roma clan (although his frequent accompanists, and later solo performers/band leaders the Ferret brothers were not Manouches but Gitan Roma) it is often called by the French name, \"jazz manouche\", or alternatively, \"manouche jazz\", even in English language sources. The term is now commonly used for this style of music.\n\nRhythm guitar in gypsy jazz uses a special form of strumming known as \"la pompe\", i.e. \"the pump\". This form of percussive rhythm is similar to the \"boom-chick\" in bluegrass styles; it is what gives the music its fast swinging feeling, and it most often emphasizes beats two and four; a vital feature of swing. The strumming hand, which never touches the top of the guitar, must make a quick up-down strum followed by a down strum. The up-down part of la pompe must be done extremely fast, regardless of the tempo of the music. It is very similar to a grace note in classical music, albeit an entire chord is used. This pattern is usually played in unison by two or more guitarists in the rhythm section.\n\nAnother important aspect of this style of playing is based on the chord shapes Django was forced to use due to his injury. Standard barre chords are not as common in gypsy jazz. Standard major and minor chords are almost never played, and are instead replaced by major 7th chords, major 6th chords, and 6/9 chords. Gypsy reharmonisation is often aimed at giving a minor feel even where a song is in a major key, for instance the substitution of a minor 6th chord for a dominant seventh. Dominant seventh chords are also altered by lowering the 9th and 13th scale degree.\n\nGypsy jazz has its own set of frequently played standards, which are fairly distinct from the standards tunes of mainstream jazz. However, contemporary ensembles may adapt almost any type of song to the style.\n\nGypsy swing standards include jazz hits of the '20s and '30s, such as \"Limehouse Blues\", and \"Dinah\"; Bal Musette numbers, often waltzes; original compositions by Django Reinhardt, such as \"Nuages\" and \"Swing 42\"; compositions by other notable gypsy swing players; and jazzed-up versions of gypsy songs, such as \"Dark Eyes\".\n\nMuch of the repertoire is in minor keys, and the dorian and harmonic minor modes are frequently heard, lending a distinctively dark and modal sound to the tunes which contrasts with the uptempo and spirited performance style. One popular example is Django's tune \"Minor Swing\", perhaps the most well-known gypsy jazz composition. Slower ballads and duets may feature rubato playing and exotic harmonies.","songs":[{"id":"xLsiquf2b92","name":"I Can't Give You Anything But Love","artist":"bJa324d3f"},{"id":"b6ZVR14ad2","name":"Hanuma","artist":"9I386e6d"},{"id":"fApua43085","name":"Tamacun","artist":"bzeFe4cf2"},{"id":"ckijCf0b38","name":"Le Pas du Chat Noir","artist":"UOEce2fc"},{"id":"bf0qyZj34a89","name":"Yor Uzga  (Uzbekistan)","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"P3Y361bf3","name":"Start Wearing Purple","artist":"7vd9b3a1"},{"id":"T6gx691b3","name":"Kol Elle Qalboh Ankawa","artist":"bTBc1fac5"},{"id":"xLr8yCb32f0","name":"Dona, Dona","artist":"bACEec398"},{"id":"b1uUNce837","name":"New Flamenco","artist":"5Cz6bd7e"},{"id":"cWIDJ226c8","name":"Mostarski Ducani: The Bazaars of Mostar","artist":"dlt538e2b"},{"id":"enu6730975","name":"The Clockwise Witness","artist":"d36842d8d"},{"id":"UGho4e0ff","name":"Simfonia Lubova","artist":"Fd26554f"}],"albums":[{"id":"ottpea659","name":"Jazz Ballads 7","artist":"bJa324d3f"},{"id":"n3JKf8c0c","name":"Rodrigo y Gabriela","artist":"bzeFe4cf2"},{"id":"eTAS66327","name":"Le  Pas du Chat Noir","artist":"UOEce2fc"},{"id":"rJqz2173a","name":"A Gypsy Legend","artist":"9I386e6d"},{"id":"nwQ1ffa1a","name":"Djangology","artist":"bJa324d3f"},{"id":"nNTQ19bf1","name":"From Luxor to Isna","artist":"bTBc1fac5"},{"id":"8v8C433e7","name":"Gypsy Punks Underdog World Str...","artist":"7vd9b3a1"},{"id":"f3QY6c44d","name":"Live in Japan","artist":"bzeFe4cf2"},{"id":"kdZJa9b68","name":"Sans Domicile Fixe","artist":"bACEec398"},{"id":"jkKea0e7e","name":"The Electric Years","artist":"bJa324d3f"},{"id":"nV3ceed04","name":"Mostar Sevdah Reunion","artist":"dlt538e2b"},{"id":"jkHuc2b1e","name":"Djangology 49","artist":"bJa324d3f"}],"artists":[{"id":"STaa54f7","name":"Stéphane Grappelli"},{"id":"CuF58009","name":"Rosenberg Trio"},{"id":"Pqy8553a","name":"Swing Shine"},{"id":"Dk5570bc","name":"Connie Evingson"},{"id":"beMmGFd54176","name":"费嘉"},{"id":"DaZdb3aa","name":"Stochelo Rosenberg"},{"id":"bhGSaeae6","name":"Jimmy Rosenberg"},{"id":"m8rVFZ63d85","name":"Angelo Debarre"},{"id":"eEaq4b4e1","name":"Joscho Stephan"},{"id":"3Stb39ae2","name":"Monsieur Perine"},{"id":"bvvef7620","name":"John Jorgenson"},{"id":"9dfkqAe21f6","name":"Biréli Lagrène"}]},{"type":"style","id":"190","name":"硬波普 Hard Bop","description":"产生于50年代，是比波普的延伸和与Cool Jazz相对的乐风。它一方面延伸了比波普节奏上的特点，但旋律却更多采用了蓝调和福音歌曲的因素，旋律比特别强调技巧的Bebop要来得轻松。\n硬波普的发展是波普爵士乐发展的必然，是波普爵士乐的一种延伸的形式。两者的主要不同是，硬波普的节奏相对更为简化，更体现灵歌的风格，节奏部乐器的演奏，主要是贝司的演奏相对松散的多，不像波普爵士乐的演奏那样相对严格遵循四拍一小节的固定节奏。福音音乐对于硬波普爵士乐的影响更为明显，钢琴和萨克斯的演奏很像早期的节奏布鲁斯音乐的风格。尽管硬波普爵士乐鼎盛时期相对波普爵士乐来说更长（从1955年到1970年），两者的区别很大程度上反映出两者的逻辑演变过程，硬波普爵士乐可以看作是波普爵士乐在五、六十年代的形式。到了六十年代的后期，在一些硬波普爵士乐音乐家的演奏中可以感觉到前卫爵士乐的影响。\nHard bop is a subgenre of jazz that is an extension of bebop (or \"bop\") music. Journalists and record companies began using the term in the mid-1950s to describe a new current within jazz which incorporated influences from rhythm and blues, gospel music, and blues, especially in saxophone and piano playing.\nHard bop is sometimes referred to as \"funky hard bop.\" The \"funky\" label refers to the rollicking, rhythmic feeling associated with the style. The descriptor is also used to describe soul jazz, which is commonly associated with hard bop. According to Mark C. Gridley, soul jazz more specifically refers to music with \"an earthy, bluesy melodic concept and... repetitive, dance-like rhythms.... Note that some listeners make no distinction between 'soul-jazz' and 'funky hard bop,' and many musicians don't consider 'soul-jazz' to be continuous with 'hard bop.'\" The term \"soul\" suggests the church, and traditional gospel music elements such as \"amen chords\" (the plagal cadence) and triadic harmonies that seemed to suddenly appear in jazz during the era.\n\nCool jazz's reign as the prevalent jazz style after bop's demise was short lived as many jazz players, especially on the east coast, wanted to return to a style of jazz that had a little more grit and aggression. Hard bop was a return to some of the ascetics of bop, but also offered some new differences. Hard bop brought back the faster tempos of the bop era, but in hard bop the harmonic changes did not come in such rapid fire succession and musicians found themselves stretching out on longer modal style solos. The new emphasis on albums rather than singles also led to longer songs. Hard bop players also began to bring more influences from the church, blues and RnB into jazz which foreshadowed the coming of soul jazz. Despite an influx of avant-garde jazz in the 60s, hard bop remained the prevalent jazz style until the emergence of fusion in the late 60s. Hard bop has enjoyed many revivals over the years and remains one of the most enduring and popular styles in jazz. Miles Davis is considered an early innovator in the field of hard bop, but Art Blakey and the many musicians who played in his Jazz Messengers are considered to be the epitome of the style.\n\nAlthough some history books claim that Hard Bop arose as a reaction to the softer sounds featured in cool jazz, it was actually an extension of bop that largely ignored West Coast jazz. The main differences between hard bop and bop are that the melodies tend to be simpler and often more \"soulful\"; the rhythm section is usually looser, with the bassist not as tightly confined to playing four-beats-to-the-bar as in bop; a gospel influence is felt in some of the music; and quite often, the saxophonists and pianists sound as if they were quite familiar with early rhythm & blues. Since the prime time period of hard bop (1955-70) was a decade later than bop, these differences were a logical evolution and one can think of hard bop as bop of the '50s and '60s. By the second half of the 1960s, the influence of the avant garde was being felt and some of the more adventurous performances of the hard bop stylists (such as Jackie McLean and Lee Morgan) fell somewhere between the two styles. With the rise of fusion and the sale of Blue Note(hard bop's top label) in the late '60s, the style fell on hard times although it was revived to a certain extent in the 1980s. Much of the music performed by the so-called Young Lions during the latter decade (due to other influences altering their style) was considered modern mainstream, although some groups (such as the Harper Brothers and T.S. Monk's sextet) have kept the 1960s' idiom alive. -- Scott Yanow","songs":[{"id":"b1pMku4436f4","name":"Autumn Leaves","artist":"GdB69ced"},{"id":"Viyg6d070","name":"They Say It's Wonderful","artist":"bsSde9eae"},{"id":"KDrC4e1c4","name":"Everything Happens to Me","artist":"SUVb11a4"},{"id":"K30E53020","name":"Flamenco Sketches","artist":"SR8dda81"},{"id":"K49ma5a7c","name":"Almost Like Being in Love","artist":"bsTD1d3e8"},{"id":"ejDiS4e708","name":"But Beautiful","artist":"SW41334c"},{"id":"ciO52efacb","name":"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face","artist":"2XZ6b4f7"},{"id":"xLozS3ca9ec","name":"Autumn in New York","artist":"SSXb4a77"},{"id":"cgLyEeb18c","name":"Song for My Father","artist":"bJb124692"},{"id":"KX3B4c8b9","name":"B Minor Waltz (For Ellaine)","artist":"c8VR3359f"},{"id":"b8fIZa72a9","name":"Moanin'","artist":"2OZ90474"},{"id":"8GaXxfe5413","name":"La Cumparsita","artist":"SQ7b52c4"}],"albums":[{"id":"jNaR9f516","name":"Bewitched","artist":"GdB69ced"},{"id":"bgHrb6d1b","name":"Kind of Blue","artist":"SR8dda81"},{"id":"f8CT5f93b","name":"Coltrane for Lovers","artist":"bsSde9eae"},{"id":"I1a8b82c","name":"Flight to Denmark","artist":"SUVb11a4"},{"id":"bhsre1ac3","name":"Red Garland's Piano","artist":"bsTD1d3e8"},{"id":"bgqsdcca4","name":"Tango","artist":"SQ7b52c4"},{"id":"bjwca924d","name":"Solo Monk","artist":"SWV1320c"},{"id":"bjlsb1388","name":"Beautiful","artist":"SW41334c"},{"id":"biCZad2ab","name":"Pavane for a Dead Princess","artist":"cYZK38cf5"},{"id":"Hc56f487","name":"You Must Believe in Spring","artist":"c8VR3359f"},{"id":"IF54deea","name":"Eastern Sounds","artist":"SVxc8217"},{"id":"FzU7e1f7","name":"Somethin' Else","artist":"2Oj8628a"}],"artists":[{"id":"SR8dda81","name":"Miles Davis"},{"id":"bsTGfec82","name":"Stan Getz"},{"id":"bsSde9eae","name":"John Coltrane"},{"id":"GdB69ced","name":"Eddie Higgins"},{"id":"SWV1320c","name":"Thelonious Monk"},{"id":"bsUxf525b","name":"Herbie Hancock"},{"id":"2Wf718b0","name":"Wes Montgomery"},{"id":"2OZ90474","name":"Art Blakey"},{"id":"SXXdb1b0","name":"Joe Pass"},{"id":"bIVi3b874","name":"Charlie Haden"},{"id":"2XZ6b4f7","name":"Sonny Rollins"},{"id":"2Oj8628a","name":"Cannonball Adderley"}]},{"type":"style","id":"183","name":"主流爵士 Mainstream Jazz","description":"主流爵士其实是爵士乐的一位评论家斯坦利．丹斯创造的，他在描述五十年代的小号演奏家巴克．克莱顿和他同期音乐家的演奏时首次使用了这个词。这些音乐家大多都是摇摆乐时代的资深音乐家，他们并不是使他们的风格现代化，并不演奏波普爵士乐，或是加入五十年代重新兴起的迪克西兰乐队，从前的大乐队时代的明星们以小乐队的形式演奏昔日的标准曲，并获得巨大的成功。\n\n在20世纪50年代斯坦利．丹斯定义了主流爵士之后，定义随着爵士音乐的演变和发展而改变。 那么以前主流的东西现在不会被认为是主流。从一般意义上讲，主流爵士乐可以被认为是当时最受欢迎的节目：例如，在摇摆乐时代 ，摇摆乐和大乐队音乐处于巅峰期，目标则是受众正在关注的音乐类型。 虽然Bebop在那段时间被引入爵士乐，但那时候的观众并没有对它有所了解。\n\nMainstream jazz is a term that was first established in the 1950s by music journalist Stanley Dance. At that time, Dance considered \"Mainstream\" anything within the popular jazz music of the Swing Era.[1] Another way to describe Mainstream Jazz in the 1950s was music that did not incorporate the bebop style.\n\nAfter Dance defined Mainstream Jazz in the 1950s, the definition changed with the evolution and progression of jazz music. What was mainstream then would not be considered mainstream now. In a general sense, Mainstream Jazz can be considered what was most popular at the time: For example, during the Swing era, swing and big band music were in their prime and what target audiences were looking for.

In the late 19th century New Orleans brass bands would perform in marches, parades and funerals playing anything from military tunes to rags in a polyphonic style similar to African-American vocal music. Since many of these marches were very lengthy, the tunes would have to be repeated many times leading the performers to improvise on the melodies to relieve their boredom.\n\nTypical New Orleans bands in this era had a front line of coronet, clarinet and trombone, while the rhythm section was composed of banjo, tuba and a percussionist. The coronet would play the melody while the clarinet would improvise counter melodies and the trombone supplied pedal points that pointed out harmonic changes while the tuba covered the bass. Improvisation would take place in a similar counter-point style with no one member being a featured soloist. The rhythm sections in early New Orleans bands would place the accent on every beat. Later the Chicago Dixieland musicians would place the accent on 2 and 4, which eventually led to the creation of RnB and rock-n-roll. Unfortunately there are no recordings of early jazz bands because the first recording of a jazz band didn't take place until 1917.\n\nThe earliest style of jazz, the music played in New Orleans from about the time that Buddy Bolden formed his first band in 1895 untilStoryville was closed in 1917, unfortunately went totally unrecorded. However with the success of the Original Dixieland Jazz Bandin 1917 and the many performances documented in the 1920s, it became possible to hear what this music sounded like in later years. Ensemble-oriented with fairly strict roles for each instrument, New Orleans Jazz generally features a trumpet or cornet providing a melodic lead, harmonies from the trombone, countermelodies by the clarinet, and a steady rhythm stated by the rhythm section (which usually consists of piano, banjo or guitar, tuba, or bass and drums). This music is a direct descendant of marching brass bands and, although overlapping with Dixieland, tends to de-emphasize solos in favor of ensembles featuring everyone playing and improvising together. Due to its fairly basic harmonies and the pure joy of the ensembles, it is consistently the happiest and most accessible style of jazz. -- Scott Yanow","songs":[{"id":"xL2T9ba1afd","name":"Autumn Leaves","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"Q8lh78e29","name":"Someday","artist":"9ea87a66"},{"id":"b04WWa73f1","name":"Red Wing","artist":"bsZs1d19d"},{"id":"mQ5Kkh4b93d","name":"I Can't Get Started","artist":"2OI54404"},{"id":"cijLkf2043","name":"Stardust","artist":"bsRKfb2eb"},{"id":"b1qiEvm42257","name":"小星星","artist":"eTtDXZ2273d"},{"id":"LLR660851","name":"Hustlin' and Bustlin' for Baby","artist":"2Pl57174"},{"id":"xLpQG7164a8","name":"Monday Night in New Orleans","artist":"4Ss5acd3"},{"id":"b14mTdfc96","name":"Joy Spring","artist":"2Ys711e3"},{"id":"b6hS9aac12","name":"Dig This!!","artist":"Y0xb0876"},{"id":"b2Weja3cf1","name":"Woo-Woo","artist":"cAVA2dab4"},{"id":"f7Fif3ef12","name":"Autumn Lamp","artist":"2Vi74163"}],"albums":[{"id":"kw1sa56b6","name":"Gold","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"t37Yid9645","name":"Live at the 1958 Monterey Jazz...","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"b9Vrf7bf1","name":"Preservation Hall Hot 4 With D...","artist":"bsZs1d19d"},{"id":"b5MIf917b","name":"Parisian Encounter","artist":"2OI54404"},{"id":"kupldfe80","name":"Butter & Eggman","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"cQs22ef1a","name":"Trumpet Evolution","artist":"2Ys711e3"},{"id":"msBjSh923fe","name":"The Centennial Anthology","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"bfYm135a3","name":"Hustlin' and Bustlin'","artist":"2Pl57174"},{"id":"jUV3c0f63","name":"Putumayo Presents: Kermit Ruff...","artist":"4Ss5acd3"},{"id":"cvAS2c35a","name":"Satchmo Serenades","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"bjUzc23fc","name":"Songs of New Orleans","artist":"bsZs1d19d"},{"id":"4q0D3625e","name":"Oh, My Nola","artist":"9ea87a66"}],"artists":[{"id":"SPub7bf6","name":"Louis Armstrong"},{"id":"SWd9c9e8","name":"Wynton Marsalis"},{"id":"2OI54404","name":"Sidney Bechet"},{"id":"SXiaa8a9","name":"Ferd 'Jelly Roll' Morton"},{"id":"bsZs1d19d","name":"Preservation Hall Jazz Band"},{"id":"4MG6545b","name":"Nicholas Payton"},{"id":"C7z8311e","name":"Linnzi Zaorski"},{"id":"2Vi74163","name":"Branford Marsalis"},{"id":"Y0xb0876","name":"Wycliffe Gordon"},{"id":"2Pl57174","name":"Ruby Braff"},{"id":"bsVYefcd2","name":"King Oliver"},{"id":"Dzy52ff9","name":"Irvin Mayfield"}]},{"type":"style","id":"36","name":"电爵士 Nu Jazz","description":"NUJAZZ（新兴爵士）：爵士面新的型态，融合电子音乐为主，也就是所谓的Nu-Jazz。Nu Jazz于90年代后期形成，是一种将Jazz架构或是Jazz演奏透过电子手法表现出的一种音乐,有时称之为电子爵士Electro Jazz或者Jazz House等等），但Nu Jazz并无较明确的模式，有时候可能运用真实乐器演奏，有时透过电子手法来表现21世纪的爵士风貌，有时艺人们（或是DJS）又会给JAZZ加入不同类型的音乐元素,例如:funk, Soul, electronic dance和一些即兴创作等等。使JAZZ乐变得多元化，所以NU-JAZZ（NU JAZZ）有时候可分做electronic jazz, electro-jazz, e-jazz,jazztronica, jazz house, phusion, \"neo-jazz\" ,future jazz.例如像是来自法国的St.German和来自德国的Jazznova等，都是当时NUJAZZ领域中的佼佼者。Nu Jazz基本上比起它的表亲Acid Jazz更朝电子领域延伸，不管它是加入了Hip Hop，House，Drum & Bass或是Broken beat等节奏元素，但基本调性仍然离不开Jazz架构。\nNu jazz, also known as jazztronica, is a genre of jazz and contemporary electronic music. The term was coined in the late 1990s to refer to music that blends jazz elements with other musical styles, such as funk, soul, electronic music, and free improvisation.\nNu jazz grew out of the combined influences of Jon Hassel’s Kiranic trumpet playing and ‘fourth world’ rhythms, Miles Davis’ soft tone and use of ambience on “In a Silent Way”, and the early 90s intersection of jazz and electronica, particularly trip-hop, dub and down-tempo. Some early Nu Jazz artists include Nils Petter Molvaer and Bugge Wesseltoft. Over time, other influences were introduced to the Nu Jazz sound.\n\nFor a time, the jangling ambient guitar sound of post-rock was a big influence on Nu Jazz, but that has mostly faded now. Meanwhile, bands like Jagga Jazzist and Snarky Puppy have re-discovered the lush orchestrations of sophisticated easy listening and exotica arrangers such as Henry Mancini and Les Baxter. Yet another influence, one that has emerged from the sound of the popular Portico Quartet and others, is the use of repeating minimalist phrases. This use of short repeating melodic phrases not only comes from minimalist composers such as Steve Reich and Phillip Glass, but also from Zeuhl artists and a long history of European art rock. An influence from ambient music is also part of the Nu Jazz genre, this can be found in the early music of Nils Petter Molvaer, as well as others. Nick Bartsch is a popular Nu Jazz artist who often combines the repeating figures of minimalism with a dub reggae style ambiance.\n\nAll of the above mentioned influences may appear on a Nu Jazz album, but not necessarily all. As Nu Jazz continues to develop, the most constant factors tend be a relaxed 'cool' approach, an influence from modern electronica and an appreciation for ironic kitsch and retro sounds. Some early precedents for Nu Jazz can found in the Terry Riley influenced ambient sections on Soft Machine's IIIrd album, Brian Eno's use of Brand X's funk/fusion backing tracks in building his late 70s ambient art rock albums, and Miles Davis' lengthy \"He Loved Him Madly\" from his \"Get Up With It\" album.\n\nAlthough there are musical differences between Nu Jazz and Contemporary Jazz, from a pop-culture standpoint, the more obvious difference between the two is Nu Jazz’s self-aware ’hipster’ stance, compared to Contemporary Jazz’s more emotionally earnest approach.","songs":[{"id":"b8Fl7a5f28","name":"Koyal (Songbird)","artist":"bcnJdb709"},{"id":"mQBEwX82b3e","name":"Booty Swing","artist":"GiV9326a"},{"id":"xLuQqYbd642","name":"The Distance","artist":"7jt8a7ca"},{"id":"gpYie49796","name":"Squeeze Me","artist":"byEOfdbae"},{"id":"bCmSs4S4adf1","name":"So Nice (Summer Samba)","artist":"VHR9de32"},{"id":"b4eCHd509a","name":"Sure Thing","artist":"Ugf158f3"},{"id":"mQYrJg51b5f","name":"There and Then (一瞬)","artist":"EQR8e24d"},{"id":"bAGSSd2ad8","name":"Queremos paz","artist":"ZJuc3da7"},{"id":"mQ6wfl94f56","name":"The Goldhearted Miner","artist":"CLC67344"},{"id":"coIZ1ec8e4","name":"Green Tea Farm","artist":"cMQ5321d6"},{"id":"8GhNPye6c9e","name":"Flashback (Funkhaus Sessions)","artist":"dShl45ee0"}],"albums":[{"id":"k6e19bed4","name":"The Princess","artist":"GiV9326a"},{"id":"ftRR5f37e","name":"Philtre","artist":"bcnJdb709"},{"id":"kvYV13b68","name":"Outside the Skyline","artist":"7jt8a7ca"},{"id":"nypUe33d9","name":"Under The Munka Moon II","artist":"bNPa245fe"},{"id":"jka6b442c","name":"Those Things","artist":"7jt8a7ca"},{"id":"nmTXlK58133","name":"Life Elsewhere","artist":"EQR8e24d"},{"id":"jGFvbb3d5","name":"Live","artist":"ZJuc3da7"},{"id":"CDcC47906","name":"Plastic People","artist":"byEOfdbae"},{"id":"eLyK5c068","name":"Tourist","artist":"Ugf158f3"},{"id":"k7nPc6451","name":"Funkhaus Studio Sessions","artist":"dShl45ee0"},{"id":"yhOPi4a0195","name":"The Burning Spider","artist":"GiV9326a"},{"id":"nfKOTg690cc","name":"Tanto Tempo Remixes","artist":"VHR9de32"}],"artists":[{"id":"GiV9326a","name":"Parov Stelar"},{"id":"cMQ5321d6","name":"上原ひろみ"},{"id":"bpm4a3c6a","name":"Thundercat"},{"id":"G4q7053b","name":"Christophe Goze"},{"id":"8G5X28f7911","name":"Hiatus Kaiyote"},{"id":"yhRutEd9829","name":"The Comet Is Coming"},{"id":"bfRobe96a","name":"Gabin"},{"id":"de3C34b4c","name":"Nicolas Repac"},{"id":"d9zU41302","name":"Skalpel"},{"id":"VYed4306","name":"Bisk"},{"id":"x8hQM5b463f","name":"Hwa"},{"id":"bamtb5a67","name":"Cuong Vu"}]},{"type":"style","id":"166","name":"后波普 Post-Bop","description":"后波普也叫新波普，将摇滚乐、节奏布鲁斯以及流行音乐引入爵士乐,并在演奏中加入电子合成乐器。\n\nPost-bop is a genre of small-combo jazz that evolved in the early to mid-1960s. Post-bop is jazz from the mid-1960s onward that assimilates hard bop, modal jazz, avant-garde and free jazz without necessarily being immediately identifiable as any of the above.[citation needed] Post-bop can refer to a variety of Jazz music that is post-bebop chronologically but in the common understanding post-bop music reflects these influences: the more open approach to the jazz ensemble crystallized by the second Miles Davis quintet, and the modal intensity of that group as well as of the classic John Coltrane Quartet.\n\nAccording to musicologist Jeremy Yudkin, post-bop does not follow \"the conventions of bop or the apparently formless freedom of the new jazz\".\nPost Bop is a modern jazz style that continues the distinguishing characteristics that separate jazz from the world of pop and rock; swing rhythm and extended harmonies (9th chords 11ths, altered chords, etc). Post Bop grew out of the Hard Bop genre during the early to mid 60s as musicians such as Bill Evans, Wayne Shorter, and Herbie Hancock began to introduce more extended harmonies, abstract structures and looser rhythms in their playing and compositions. When Hancock and Shorter joined Miles Davis’ quintet in the mid-60s, that group became the perfect vehicle for extending the boundaries of what could happen in a Post Bop format. The Miles Davis Quintet albums, \"Nefertiti\" and \"Sorcer\", continue to be pinnacles of Post Bop composition and performance. Some styles of free modal jazz, such as Coltrane's \"A Love Supreme\", are also part of the Post Bop sound. Although there are still some musicians, such as Kenny Garret, who play in that style, mostly that sound has been fading since the early 70s.\n\nWhile still in its infancy, Post Bop was pushed off the radar during the 70s as many of its early proponents pursued the far more lucrative fields of fusion and smooth jazz. As the fusion fad began to fade, musicians began to tire of three chord vamps and the limitations of rock/pop rhythms and yearned to work with sophisticated chord changes and jazz rhythms again. The stage was set in the early 80s for the “young lion” movement and a return to both Post Bop and Hard Bop for a lot of young musicians and their fan base.\n\nToday’s Post Bop covers a wide variety, from radio friendly to borderline avant-garde, and it’s a genre that is still ripe for more exploration. Generally speaking, the difference between Post Bop and Hard Bop is that Hard Bop carries a stronger trace of the blues and a more straight forward driving rhythm, but when you are trying to analyze certain artists or pieces of music, that difference is not always clear. Much of Branford Marsalis's music is a good example of jazz that sits right between post and hard bop. With some music, arguing whether it is Post Bop or Hard Bop becomes pointless, since depending on perspective, either genre can be seen as a subset of the other. Although we use the genre term Post Bop to tag the music described above, in a more generic sense, post bop can be the name of any swing based jazz music created after the passing of the be-bop era.\n\nPart 2 - Post Bop in the New Century\n\nAs jazz continues to grow and develop, the worlds of modern fusion and post bop have grown closer together as many musicians; such as Dave Douglas, Craig Taborn, Greg Osby and others, freely mix elements into new hybrids.\n\nAt JMA, the distinction between Fusion and Post Bop continues to be that distinctive African syncopation known as \"swing\". Generally Post Bop should swing, while Fusion, quite often does not. What has changed, as we move further into the 21st century, is the way in which modern drummers are 'swinging'. Inventive drummers such as Jeff \"Tain\" Watts, Rudy Roystan and others are no longer putting the swing beat solely on the ride cymbal. Instead, they are liable to use any, or all pieces of the drum set at once, while they swing the beat. Also, the swing feel itself is often a bit disguised in modern jazz, it may not be so obvious, and the drummer may move in and out of swing feel, sometimes even within one phrase.","songs":[{"id":"b1pMku4436f4","name":"Autumn Leaves","artist":"GdB69ced"},{"id":"clvjbfa061","name":"Don't Worry, Be Happy","artist":"SWtb7431"},{"id":"Viyg6d070","name":"They Say It's Wonderful","artist":"bsSde9eae"},{"id":"K30E53020","name":"Flamenco Sketches","artist":"SR8dda81"},{"id":"LXlZ8004b","name":"Don't Ever Leave Me","artist":"SU79f012"},{"id":"cq5ZIff09e","name":"Estate (Summer)","artist":"4OQ71cf4"},{"id":"UEgL83bf1","name":"The Things We Did Last Summer","artist":"FbR9312d"},{"id":"b0Uuhc0857","name":"Soirée","artist":"c8VR3359f"},{"id":"Rta4e06c9","name":"When I Fall in Love","artist":"Aiv8c16b"},{"id":"b7q2sc56d5","name":"Say It (Over and Over Again)","artist":"bajod16e4"},{"id":"cOAHy21cd3","name":"September Second","artist":"SYo15688"},{"id":"coEwGe74e3","name":"The Masquerade Is Over","artist":"Cp985817"}],"albums":[{"id":"jNaR9f516","name":"Bewitched","artist":"GdB69ced"},{"id":"bgHrb6d1b","name":"Kind of Blue","artist":"SR8dda81"},{"id":"Ir082aee","name":"The Melody at Night, With You","artist":"SU79f012"},{"id":"eYhX639ab","name":"Don't Worry, Be Happy","artist":"SWtb7431"},{"id":"f8CT5f93b","name":"Coltrane for Lovers","artist":"bsSde9eae"},{"id":"jIhfad1a3","name":"Bossa Nova Stories","artist":"4OQ71cf4"},{"id":"jwI4d17d0","name":"Portrait in Jazz","artist":"Aiv8c16b"},{"id":"nU6vfe0c8","name":"The Things We Did Last Summer","artist":"FbR9312d"},{"id":"nsL3ed23a","name":"Cello Blue","artist":"6nI74f31"},{"id":"biCZad2ab","name":"Pavane for a Dead Princess","artist":"cYZK38cf5"},{"id":"b7ebe42f0","name":"From Left to Right","artist":"c8VR3359f"},{"id":"Hc56f487","name":"You Must Believe in Spring","artist":"c8VR3359f"}],"artists":[{"id":"SR8dda81","name":"Miles Davis"},{"id":"c8VR3359f","name":"Bill Evans"},{"id":"SU79f012","name":"Keith Jarrett"},{"id":"bsTGfec82","name":"Stan Getz"},{"id":"bsSde9eae","name":"John Coltrane"},{"id":"SWtb7431","name":"Bobby McFerrin"},{"id":"GdB69ced","name":"Eddie Higgins"},{"id":"4KY75bc5","name":"Marcus Miller"},{"id":"SWV1320c","name":"Thelonious Monk"},{"id":"bsUxf525b","name":"Herbie Hancock"},{"id":"Aiv8c16b","name":"Bill Evans Trio"},{"id":"2VG8a461","name":"Pat Metheny"}]},{"type":"style","id":"178","name":"拉格泰姆 Ragtime","description":"Regtime（拉格泰姆）爵士乐融合了欧洲古典音乐和欧洲军乐的特点而产生的。他打乱了古典音乐中严格的节拍规律，有演奏者掌握节奏的迟缓。乐曲的进行通常是起奏延缓，随即强调音节，这种风格在当时的钢琴演奏中极为常见。Regtime爵士乐在二十世纪出的十五年中非常盛行，虽然这种风格对爵士乐的形式具有非常重大的影响但是因为它缺乏Blues的感觉和没有即兴感觉，所以并不能称之为真正的爵士乐，但却是爵士乐发展中一种重要的音乐型态，以直立式钢琴演奏完全写谱的音乐，并强调切分音，风格略为呆板。\n\nRagtime是一种采用黑人旋律，依切分音法(Syncopation)循环主题与变形乐句等法则，结合而成的早期爵士乐，盛行於第一次世界大战前後。其发源与圣路易斯与纽奥尔良，而後美国的南方和中西部开始流行，它影响了纽奥尔良传统爵士乐的独奏与即兴演奏风格。繁音拍子後来发展成结合流行音乐、进行曲、华尔兹与其他流行舞蹈的型式，因此繁音拍子的歌曲、乐器管弦乐队编制的曲目陆续出现，它不但在黑人乐手与乐迷间流行，也被美国白人中产阶级所接受。Ragtime – also spelled rag-time or rag time – is a musical style that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \"ragged\", rhythm.\nTechnically Ragtime isn't really jazz because it does not involve improvisation, but ragtime ran a parallel career to the early New Orleans jazz and featured similar melodies and rhythms. A simple way to look at ragtime is to consider it as a form of composed jazz, or possibly America's first classical music. Likewise, in a style similar to classical music, ragtime's rhythmic syncopations don't swing quite to the degree that they do in New Orleans jazz performance. Although ragtime first appeared in 1892, Scott Joplin would begin to dominate and define the genre in 1895.\n\nThe Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz opens with back to back renditions of Maple Leaf Rag by ragtime pianist Scott Joplin and early jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton. In these two performances of this same piece you can clearly hear the difference between ragtime and jazz as Morton's version swings with free abandon, while Joplin's stricter version is more similar to the European late romantic period style of Chopin.\nAlthough lacking the improvisation or the blues feeling inherent in jazz, Ragtime was a strong influence on the earlier forms of jazz. At its prime from 1899-1915, ragtime is best known as totally written out piano music, though it was also performed by orchestras. Its syncopations and structure (blending together aspects of classical music and marches) hinted strongly at jazz, and many of its melodies (most notably \"Maple Leaf Rag\") would be played in later years by jazz musicians in a Dixieland context. -- Scott Yanow","songs":[{"id":"mQ9LOLc331d","name":"在路上","artist":"OTo691c1"},{"id":"KCiy9192a","name":"The Entertainer","artist":"cYZz5abdb"},{"id":"xLwI4Kc6880","name":"The Crave","artist":"SXiaa8a9"},{"id":"b3GoNd1220","name":"Go 'Way from My Window","artist":"49s17b0c"},{"id":"bqvpkX73a149","name":"The Entertainer (Orchestra Version)","artist":"92W65bc5"},{"id":"mQ55It8672f","name":"Police Dog Blues","artist":"3kj8f8c9"},{"id":"f7Fif3ef12","name":"Autumn Lamp","artist":"2Vi74163"},{"id":"8G1Gfife1db","name":"焦虑的不二酒馆","artist":"bBZlAwd47d88"},{"id":"b5Mtkb21e2","name":"Elite Syncopations","artist":"Yc6df933"},{"id":"bqvbHJ03915d","name":"Saturday Night Fish Fry","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"cmIOP18a00","name":"The Entertainer","artist":"90n5c460"},{"id":"JAXE4a34f8a","name":"Bugsy Malone","artist":"UuB9fc05"}],"albums":[{"id":"sJMz23cd8","name":"白日梦","artist":"OTo691c1"},{"id":"dSaQDRfd346","name":"Ragtime","artist":"cYZz5abdb"},{"id":"jcOXaed88","name":"Ballads and Blues 1972: The Ea...","artist":"49s17b0c"},{"id":"guyU59f1f","name":"Complete Library of Congress R...","artist":"SXiaa8a9"},{"id":"I0r569a2","name":"Ragtime Piano Roll","artist":"cYZz5abdb"},{"id":"xv1GbEa9b21","name":"The Red Back Book","artist":"cYZz5abdb"},{"id":"fRMb70e3c","name":"King Of Ragtime","artist":"cYZz5abdb"},{"id":"fhC989a7a","name":"The Sting (Original Motion Pic...","artist":"92W65bc5"},{"id":"nztOf7d63","name":"Piano Rags","artist":"Yc6df933"},{"id":"fLHW81296","name":"Ragtime Guitar's Foremost Fing...","artist":"3kj8f8c9"},{"id":"IXU4fe5c","name":"Romare Bearden Revealed","artist":"2Vi74163"},{"id":"b82d1a8b0","name":"Scott Joplin: His Greatest Hit...","artist":"cYZz5abdb"}],"artists":[{"id":"cjdc2b2a9","name":"Art Tatum"},{"id":"cYZz5abdb","name":"Scott Joplin"},{"id":"SXiaa8a9","name":"Ferd 'Jelly Roll' Morton"},{"id":"bzJd1d4dd","name":"Claude Bolling"},{"id":"SUsb7ced","name":"Dick Hyman"},{"id":"3kj8f8c9","name":"Blind Blake"},{"id":"2TO60c3e","name":"James P.

It was the original intention of JMA to list the soul jazz artists in hard bop, but the line was drawn at the bluesy B3 organ players such as Groove Holmes and Jack McDuff. Put simply, soul jazz is instrumental RnB or blues with a swing or funk beat topped with virtuoso jazz solos. You can also find soul jazz artists on JMA in the hard bop, funk jazz, and acid jazz genres.\n\nSoul-Jazz, which was the most popular jazz style of the 1960s, differs from bebop and hard bop (from which it originally developed) in that the emphasis is on the rhythmic groove. Although soloists follow the chords as in bop, the basslines (often played by an organist if not a string bassist) dance rather than stick strictly to a four-to-the bar walking pattern. The musicians build their accompaniment around the bassline and, although there are often strong melodies, it is the catchiness of the groove and the amount of heat generated by the soloists that determine whether the performance is successful. Soul-jazz's roots trace back to pianist Horace Silver, whose funky style infused bop with the influence of church and gospel music, along with the blues. Other pianists who followed and used similar approaches were Bobby Timmons, Junior Mance, Les McCann, Gene Harris (with his Three Sounds), andRamsey Lewis. With the emergence of organist Jimmy Smith in 1956 (who has dominated his instrument ever since), soul-jazz organ combos (usually also including a tenor, guitarist, drummer, and an occasional bassist) caught on, and soulful players became stars, including Brother Jack McDuff, Shirley Scott, Jimmy McGriff, Charles Earland, and Richard \"Groove\" Holmes, along with such other musicians as guitarists Grant Green, George Benson and Kenny Burrell; tenors Stanley Turrentine, Willis \"Gator\" Jackson, Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis, David \"Fathead\" Newman, Gene \"Jug\" Ammons, Houston Person, Jimmy Forrest, King Curtis, Red Holloway, and Eddie Harris; and altoist Hank Crawford. Despite its eclipse by fusion and synthesizers in the 1970s, soul-jazz has stayed alive and made a healthy comeback in recent years. — Scott Yanow","songs":[{"id":"b4YoS9e7c8","name":"Fuck Me Pumps","artist":"lbPox5b329"},{"id":"xL9KGpb1178","name":"Nothing's Gonna Change My Love For You","artist":"2OP57a42"},{"id":"b1pO0XR3c72e","name":"To Be With You","artist":"IbG764b9"},{"id":"cgLyEeb18c","name":"Song for My Father","artist":"bJb124692"},{"id":"mSutH77ceb4","name":"失落街角 (Meu Coração)","artist":"cArYSGb2ce6"},{"id":"d2L8l2a1bb","name":"The Shadow of Your Smile","artist":"2Wf718b0"},{"id":"UUho71e10","name":"Manhã de Carnaval","artist":"SV914872"},{"id":"xNfBoNc6df1","name":"问情","artist":"OUz8a783"},{"id":"mQ6Yrxc3ba4","name":"All the Way","artist":"Tcwa1d1d"},{"id":"gkik64431a","name":"Deep River","artist":"bIUW214c0"},{"id":"cMRJ221fbe","name":"Takes Two to Tango","artist":"btd11cbc4"},{"id":"xN2eSQa3dfd","name":"关键是金针菇","artist":"eF6u8ccc9"}],"albums":[{"id":"eVBm5a355","name":"Frank","artist":"lbPox5b329"},{"id":"jYLtff742","name":"Music Castle","artist":"IbG764b9"},{"id":"mpKrkQ9417e","name":"The Ultimate Collection","artist":"2OP57a42"},{"id":"yhPfrVc5d1b","name":"司徒先生","artist":"cArYSGb2ce6"},{"id":"yh5839c5f90","name":"The Island","artist":"cArYSGb2ce6"},{"id":"cbBf530b5","name":"The Genius of Ray Charles","artist":"btd11cbc4"},{"id":"yhEKKM97b6e","name":"寂静之声","artist":"bC6WpWs45b40"},{"id":"nnhjpad535f","name":"音乐国里有老虎","artist":"eF6u8ccc9"},{"id":"K125a0b5","name":"Song for My Father","artist":"bJb124692"},{"id":"fTX7926e0","name":"Jazz","artist":"Tcwa1d1d"},{"id":"biRPa6e4e","name":"Somewhere Over The Rainbow","artist":"SVPdfae6"},{"id":"b8MEf329c","name":"Bossa Nova","artist":"SV914872"}],"artists":[{"id":"lbPox5b329","name":"Amy Winehouse"},{"id":"OUz8a783","name":"袁娅维"},{"id":"2Wf718b0","name":"Wes Montgomery"},{"id":"OTo691c1","name":"朱家明"},{"id":"2Oj8628a","name":"Cannonball Adderley"},{"id":"iQWLcdd48","name":"Eddie Beatz"},{"id":"ciZM2d068","name":"Lee Morgan"},{"id":"80p6e4c4","name":"나윤선"},{"id":"bsWZf8c93","name":"Pat Martino"},{"id":"bIUW214c0","name":"Grant Green"},{"id":"SQ3d90aa","name":"Kenny Burrell"},{"id":"SUobd988","name":"Freddie Hubbard"}]},{"type":"style","id":"180","name":"爵士钢琴 Stride Piano","description":"暂无","songs":[{"id":"bCmXKWH48b9e","name":"THE DESERTED CASTLE, PRINCESS AND PRINCE TRILOGY","artist":"iQIr9aa8e"},{"id":"mS1rCR7b342","name":"In A Sentimental Mood (Alternate Take)","artist":"cjdc2b2a9"}],"albums":[{"id":"NiN88U219c7","name":"The Classic Trio Recordings 19...","artist":"2RQ58eb4"},{"id":"JXvJTi210e8","name":"The Tatum Group Masterpieces, ...","artist":"cjdc2b2a9"},{"id":"nniQqt931dc","name":"波杰克特三 PROJECT 3","artist":"iQIr9aa8e"},{"id":"btTiYSl39cf1","name":"Brown Loop","artist":"bC7DayY45a7f"}],"artists":[{"id":"cjdc2b2a9","name":"Art Tatum"},{"id":"cMQ5321d6","name":"上原ひろみ"},{"id":"bf2C9d779","name":"大野雄二"},{"id":"dzg63daa8","name":"Fats Waller"},{"id":"dOV7488ca","name":"Albert Ammons"},{"id":"SUsb7ced","name":"Dick Hyman"},{"id":"UGY10566","name":"Mary Lou Williams"},{"id":"bsX0f2794","name":"Jay McShann"},{"id":"2TO60c3e","name":"James P.

Jazz caught the ear of many composers in the early 20th century and soon Ravel, Debussy, Stravinsky and others began to put elements of American ragtime into their music. French composer Darius Milhaud furthered these experiments that culminated in George Gershwin's 'Blue Monday' and 'Rhapsody in Blue', two pieces which represented some of the first truly successful fusions of jazz and concert hall music.\n\nFrom the jazz side of things, early attempts at classical influence came from Duke Ellington, Artie Shaw, Woody Herman, Bix Beiderbecke, James P. Johnson and others. Gunther Schuller and John Lewis' 'Third Stream Music', which combined a string quartet with a cool jazz combo, was one of the first entirely successful concert hall pieces by a jazz composer.\n\nIn today's music world, Third Stream often refers to compositions that have some element of jazz. At JMA, the Third Stream genre is also where you will find jazz or jazz related music that relies on composition more than improvisation.\n\nImprovisation is generally seen as a vital component of Third Stream. In 1961, Schuller defined Third Stream as \"a new genre of music located about halfway between jazz and classical music\".","songs":[{"id":"MMky514ab","name":"Canon in D Major","artist":"ULr9f3e1"},{"id":"emgsK33d7c","name":"Four Comets, Pt. 1","artist":"2ZN51763"},{"id":"mQ6Pcy74e16","name":"Ravel's Bolero","artist":"c12o25d49"},{"id":"civTVe40cd","name":"Bach Prelude in G Major (From the Cello Suite)","artist":"c9bC2d50b"},{"id":"eQ4GN3665c","name":"Rococo in Rock","artist":"ULqd2770"},{"id":"O1jX4c4a2","name":"A Grand Night for Swinging","artist":"UGY10566"},{"id":"OgpE8d59f","name":"Concorde","artist":"2VX8fbc2"},{"id":"cg1H0e9931","name":"Her","artist":"bsTGfec82"},{"id":"cgyxwe4750","name":"Concierto De Aranjuez (Adagio)","artist":"SR8dda81"},{"id":"b2x7Ya22f0","name":"A Rainbow in Curved Air","artist":"5Qpba15f"},{"id":"mQDltA702f3","name":"Like Someone in Love","artist":"c8VR3359f"},{"id":"bAO7jbd2e8","name":"Quechua Song","artist":"bsTBe607c"}],"albums":[{"id":"je9Ub0067","name":"Baroque Favorites","artist":"ULr9f3e1"},{"id":"bkTAcb261","name":"Anthem","artist":"2ZN51763"},{"id":"eS0E60303","name":"Ravel: Bolero","artist":"c12o25d49"},{"id":"oRnuf3617","name":"The Sideman Years","artist":"c8VR3359f"},{"id":"eS0b682e3","name":"Rococo Jazz, Vol. 2","artist":"ULqd2770"},{"id":"bjI4f4702","name":"Heart of the Bass","artist":"c9bC2d50b"},{"id":"vEmG2c1e6","name":"Mary Lou Williams Presents Bla...","artist":"UGY10566"},{"id":"eS1g4dac8","name":"Bach: The Brandenburgs","artist":"c12o25d49"},{"id":"dpyo3abc4","name":"Concorde","artist":"2VX8fbc2"},{"id":"b6Im181ed","name":"Sketches of Spain","artist":"SR8dda81"},{"id":"jeAd14e7e","name":"Solo Piano: Impressions on Cho...","artist":"ULr9f3e1"},{"id":"C1As448e1","name":"Spring Song","artist":"ULqd2770"}],"artists":[{"id":"dQR843e21","name":"John Zorn"},{"id":"bsTBe607c","name":"Jan Garbarek"},{"id":"2Yh80167","name":"Pete Rugolo"},{"id":"5Qpba15f","name":"Terry Riley"},{"id":"ULr9f3e1","name":"Jacques Loussier"},{"id":"2ZN51763","name":"Ralph Towner"},{"id":"2Yt56cf3","name":"Lalo Schifrin"},{"id":"2VX8fbc2","name":"The Modern Jazz Quartet"},{"id":"9E851525","name":"Eberhard Weber"},{"id":"SUya7734","name":"Milt Jackson"},{"id":"ULqd2770","name":"Eugen Cicero"},{"id":"SUH16378","name":"J.J.

Obviously here is where you will find vocalists who sing in a distictive jazz style, or styles I should say because although there is a similarity of delivery in the jazz nuances of these listed singers, the performing era and genre style of singers you will find here ranges from Billy Holliday to Doris Day and on to Norah Jones.﻿\n\nMost of the 20th century's great vocalists performed in the jazz idiom, though not all rank in the style known as vocal jazz. While singers from Russ Columbo to Doris Day to Johnny Mathis relied on talent and vocal strength alone to carry material, vocal jazz artists instead chose to interpret standards in much the same way as the great jazz instrumentalists, so their readings of the great American songbook required talents related to improvisation, musicianship, harmony, even personalization to bring new meanings to the lyrics. A pair of early giants, Louis Armstrong and Bing Crosby, recorded distinctive readings of standards, relying on a delivery that was casual yet very focused — an almost total break with the professional vocal traditions of the past. From the big-band era came dozens of major jazz vocalists, and in fact, most of the best: Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Tormé, Anita O'Day, Sarah Vaughan, Peggy Lee, Joe Williams; all of them worked long hours touring with swing bands, and most were repaid in kind with major success during the post-war era, when the style really bloomed. Though it wasn't always easy separating jazz vocalists from traditional pop singers, many in the jazz repertoire usually earned the tag by delivering variations of their material in performance or scatting in emulation of a jazz soloist. They also generally refused no-name orchestras and generic pop hits of the day, preferring instead the work of talented arrangers (Nelson Riddle, Billy May) and truly great composers (Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, the Gershwins). Singers of the post-war era began stretching the concepts of not swing but bop, interpreting the frantic tempoes and exploratory solos of jazz instrumentalists with their own vocal experiments. Lambert, Hendricks & Ross indulged in manic harmonies, while a host of singers (including Betty Carter, Mark Murphy, and Abbey Lincoln) explored different charts, radical material, and much improvisation. Even while the ranks of jazz vocalists thinned during the 1970s and '80s, many artists continued in the style.","songs":[{"id":"mQLB0t5d5cd","name":"The Runaround","artist":"cxVW29006"},{"id":"OEjx559b4","name":"Don't Know Why","artist":"6ff931a3"},{"id":"b4FaKa5a11","name":"Nine Million Bicycles","artist":"6h57b32d"},{"id":"ch4v7fc27b","name":"What a Wonderful World","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"TBmS6e572","name":"La Vie En Rose ","artist":"6hG7d2d1"},{"id":"b4BFWab3a7","name":"I Don't Miss You Anymore","artist":"bwgYe403b"},{"id":"NH1P595e5","name":"The Look of Love","artist":"dPb6492d9"},{"id":"bAGKTa1344","name":"I Don't Want to Talk About It","artist":"b5iOf87c6"},{"id":"bqvni863c2c2","name":"Tangled Up","artist":"bista5aa6"},{"id":"fNCG7097b","name":"You Don't Trust Me At All","artist":"fAXac7e4"},{"id":"OUUxe8f09","name":"Be Still My Heart","artist":"bwvXe9e16"},{"id":"bBh8Ocee59","name":"Another Day","artist":"F8T71965"}],"albums":[{"id":"8qPI3e981","name":"Come Away With Me","artist":"6ff931a3"},{"id":"jfX796ed2","name":"Feels Like Home","artist":"6ff931a3"},{"id":"mZAUt154dac","name":"The Same Sun","artist":"cxVW29006"},{"id":"jgmjab0f1","name":"Piece by Piece","artist":"6h57b32d"},{"id":"F7K7a51c","name":"What a Wonderful World","artist":"SPub7bf6"},{"id":"nO3Oeaa66","name":"DANS MON ILE","artist":"6hG7d2d1"},{"id":"eKB6092b","name":"绝世名伶","artist":"fAXac7e4"},{"id":"eUdg56260","name":"Pictures","artist":"6h57b32d"},{"id":"eTPa89f75","name":"Sings Salvadore Poe","artist":"bwgYe403b"},{"id":"wvvD2813e","name":"Malene","artist":"F8T71965"},{"id":"biBJ9bad7","name":"The Look of Love","artist":"dPb6492d9"},{"id":"8oOZy3f9e5a","name":"The Shocking Miss Emerald","artist":"bista5aa6"}],"artists":[{"id":"SPub7bf6","name":"Louis Armstrong"},{"id":"cClP2ee41","name":"Michael Bublé"},{"id":"6h57b32d","name":"Katie Melua"},{"id":"bISR259a0","name":"Nat King Cole"},{"id":"SP3dae8b","name":"Chet Baker"},{"id":"dPb6492d9","name":"Diana Krall"},{"id":"4tn8f358","name":"Frank Sinatra"},{"id":"cYWX3bd36","name":"Ella Fitzgerald"},{"id":"bwgYe403b","name":"Lisa Ekdahl"},{"id":"BGN85ad6","name":"Stacey Kent"},{"id":"SUd1020e","name":"Billie Holiday"},{"id":"6pD6b98c","name":"Laura Fygi"}]}]},{"type":"genre","id":"12","name":"轻音乐 Easy Listening","description":"轻音乐，是指那种风格轻松、活泼的音乐，它是能给人以愉悦和抒情感，优美动听、通俗易懂的音乐。所谓“轻”，是指与庄重的严肃音乐对比而言。舞曲、进行曲、小夜曲比奏鸣曲、交响曲要“轻”；轻歌曲、抒情歌曲、诙谐歌曲比大合唱、清唱剧要轻；喜歌剧要比正剧要 “轻”。形象地说，它是音乐中的轻武器，和文学里的小品文、笑话、抒情诗等大致相同。轻音乐在当前人们的音乐生活中占有重要的地位。优美、健康的轻音乐不仅可供消遣娱乐，同时也能陶冶情操，提高欣赏者的音乐水平。\n轻音乐作品的旋律优美动听、清晰流畅，节奏鲜明轻快，音色丰富多彩，深受人们喜爱。总括起来说，轻音乐的特点是：结构短小，旋律动听、形式不拘一格。乐队组织精炼、配器新颖、节奏鲜明。它能较细腻地表达人的思想感情。\n在人民群众中间，轻音乐十分普及，具有广泛的社会意义和精神作用。轻音乐的种类较多，它包括一般的生活歌曲、抒情歌曲、诙谐歌曲、讽刺歌曲，还包括一些轻歌剧、圆舞曲、小型管弦乐序曲、小夜曲，以及部分管弦乐曲小品、电影歌曲、舞蹈音乐、优美钢琴曲等。\n\nEasy Listening music is instrumental music that was designed to be soothing and relaxing. Unlike jazz, which demands your utmost attention, easy listening slips into the background, which is the very reason many critics and listeners dismissed the music as nothing more than disposible fluff. Although some records certainly fall into that category, there were a number of inventive arrangers and conductors working in the genre, such as Martin Denny, Les Baxter and Esquivel, who distinguished themselves with unpredictable instrumentation and idiosyncratic arrangements. Still, the primary characteristic of easy listening, from Ray Conniff's lush wordless vocals to the Latin flourishes of Herb Alpert, is that it's pleasant and easy on the

Vie En

The music typically conjures up images of exotic foreign tourist destinations geared toward white Americans, and in that sense, it's sort of the equivalent of a pre-packaged resort vacation -- fun, inauthentic, and safely familiar. Exotica is usually arranged for standard orchestras, with instrumentation added according to the location being evoked (ethnic percussion, string instruments, etc.); some exotica also borrows the weird, otherworldly sound effects that define the space-age pop style. Even in its '50s/early-'60s heyday, exotica was often derided as cheesy and contrived, but its '90s revival among alternative music fans embraced those very qualities (albeit ironically), and also brought a sincere reassessment of the music's inventive production techniques.

It is also called bachelor pad music or lounge music.[1] Space age pop was inspired by the spirit of those times, an optimism based on the strong post-war economy and technology boom, and excitement about humanity's early forays into space.[2][3] Although there is no specific album, date, or year when the genre was born, producer Irwin Chusid identifies its heyday as \"roughly 1954 to 1963—from the dawn of high-fidelity (hi-fi) to the arrival of the Beatles.\"[4]\nThe music is not limited to a single style, and it is not always easily categorized. There are several styles that can be recognized as an influence: classical composers like Ravel and Debussy; the big bands of the 1940s; and different exotic styles, such as samba, latin, and calypso jazz. Space Age pop is related to the genres of lounge music, exotica, or beautiful music,[2] and may be regarded as a precursor to the musical genre of space music.","songs":[{"id":"b82Yfc8550","name":"A Dream","artist":"bbVbc414e"},{"id":"8IBD9bea733","name":"情话微甜","artist":"df7l63ae3ef"},{"id":"mTqkZi82807","name":"送别 流浪 地球","artist":"yivpysd8756"},{"id":"mSVHg9562fc","name":"命运的最后","artist":"yivkLrc2b75"},{"id":"mTpDiP7bca8","name":"G.O.A.T(Dyoself Version)","artist":"Ju0ak91fb37"},{"id":"xNSU6Fa8d25","name":"she likes spike but she dont like his back.","artist":"nnEOUS4ca48"},{"id":"bCmW12646174","name":"A Lullaby","artist":"nmSzwO8c26d"},{"id":"bCkPQOc48f8e","name":"Lotus Land","artist":"8dYBkJ18e23"},{"id":"xOhUvxdfcf8","name":"在一切还未成形之前向中心聚拢","artist":"yhDt2Ab7914"},{"id":"xNdfhqbd365","name":"Mas Que Nada","artist":"AcE8cdbd"},{"id":"8IElEL18783","name":"Death Star","artist":"dk8kfRd5ef9"},{"id":"xL1doJc1d63","name":"Electronic Can-Can","artist":"buD6e8038"}],"albums":[{"id":"nnqA8a851f7","name":"迷雾东方","artist":"USJhaE3d770"},{"id":"wfjK40994","name":"One Stormy Night","artist":"bbVbc414e"},{"id":"nnk34S6b0b1","name":"情话微甜","artist":"df7l63ae3ef"},{"id":"yhUcXfbd26f","name":"电影《非常人类非常的我末代妖精2018》原声碟配乐合集","artist":"yivkLrc2b75"},{"id":"JX2CwK242b8","name":"流浪地球物语","artist":"yivpysd8756"},{"id":"j4IWdef90","name":"Stormy Memories","artist":"bbVbc414e"},{"id":"nGSaef00d","name":"Erogenous","artist":"bbVbc414e"},{"id":"fs9J53319","name":"Stormy Weekend","artist":"bbVbc414e"},{"id":"CodXNQeacab","name":"火星流浪","artist":"nn9fxE7d3eb"},{"id":"nno1KV5772a","name":"Sound of My Dream","artist":"yi2SEJd9652"},{"id":"bC7hHPS4984b","name":"Soul Coaxing: The Many Moods o...","artist":"AcE8cdbd"},{"id":"fs9I65b72","name":"Love Token","artist":"bbVbc414e"}],"artists":[{"id":"bbvuadd91","name":"Jean-Jacques Perrey"},{"id":"buD6e8038","name":"Perrey & Kingsley"},{"id":"4BB8ca83","name":"Bruce Haack"},{"id":"dPfE47df9","name":"Raymond Scott"},{"id":"nmS3P378f47","name":"彩色海"},{"id":"bz5Af1770","name":"Esquivel"},{"id":"bbVbc414e","name":"Mystic Moods Orchestra"},{"id":"UCBc0850","name":"Lucia Pamela"},{"id":"dQKm49d7f","name":"Andre Popp"},{"id":"nnIiTI885b2","name":"VZIM"},{"id":"GMk83715","name":"Kenyon Hopkins"},{"id":"9dfkWFe43d2","name":"郑物尘"}]},{"type":"style","id":"715","name":"器乐流行 Instrumental Pop","description":"流行音乐中器乐作品的特点是：节奏鲜明，轻松活泼或抒情优美，演奏方法多种多样，音响多变，色彩丰富，织体层次简明，乐队规模不大，现代作品多使用电声乐器。声乐作品的特点是：生活气息浓郁、抒情、风趣、音域不宽，手法通俗、曲调顺口、易于传唱；歌词多用生活语言，浅显易，易为听者接受和传唱；歌手多是自成一格的流行歌星，发声方法各有千秋，不受声乐学派的约束，演唱时感情重于声音技巧，动和自由不羁，自然亲切，易引起听众的共鸣；小乐队的强声伴奏与歌声融为一体。由于流行音乐具备上述特点，所以就能够和群众连在一起，无论文化水平的高低，都易于接受。\n\nInstrumental Pop is purely an easy listening style, not to be confused with instrumental pop/rock, instrumental R&B, or jazz-pop. It is most often performed by orchestras, which may feature symphonic or big-band-jazz instrumentation, but it may cover anything from small brass ensembles to -- in the case of instrumental pop stalwart Lawrence Welk -- polka groups. Many instrumental pop recordings draw upon an already existing repertoire of traditional pop standards, as well as jazz and rock songs that can be adapted to fit the easy listening style; this approach emphasizes the skills of the conductor and arranger, since the audience will likely be familiar with the melodies. There are many exceptions, however, one of the most immediately identifiable being the recordings of skilled composers like Henry Mancini and Bert Kaempfert, who introduced their own standards into the pop canon. Instrumental pop is sometimes geared to be romantic, sometimes carefree and upbeat, but above all, it's light, soothing, comfortable music.","songs":[{"id":"xLpDZqcf1bc","name":"The Truth That You Leave","artist":"Fo992be2"},{"id":"8Gi2Roe4e6d","name":"星空のピアニスト","artist":"bP6s23881"},{"id":"xNVPCxa0765","name":"北京的秋天","artist":"nnFfs3b7aa3"},{"id":"esEHp3403c","name":"The Lonely Shepherd","artist":"bfqa973f0"},{"id":"U5KooE26839","name":"夜的钢琴曲五","artist":"kiKhdI47043"},{"id":"mSZQQC8b542","name":"盗将行","artist":"nmSzFa63a63"},{"id":"mTgpCM80d5e","name":"起风了","artist":"9dfkY7e4c5e"},{"id":"8IxECee722b","name":"梦中的婚礼","artist":"yiul7ca9146"},{"id":"xNdhW31496c","name":"迪迦奥特曼 - LOVE Theme from TIGA","artist":"yiufqAd4329"},{"id":"eRxvO36467","name":"Moon River","artist":"bsWdefe84"},{"id":"8ItFsefa844","name":"蒲公英的约定｜钢琴","artist":"b1CTiO342007"},{"id":"b6PjZdb14d","name":"On the Beautiful Blue Danube","artist":"Z4ld755d"}],"albums":[{"id":"jTV5b5cac","name":"A Best","artist":"Fo992be2"},{"id":"sCZI23ba7","name":"Serenity","artist":"OVu8f41c"},{"id":"nnjdCO9393b","name":"抖音热门作品 原声纯音乐辑","artist":"9dfkY7e4c5e"},{"id":"jQUAc49b9","name":"Playing the Piano 2009 Japan","artist":"gWPc4394"},{"id":"D3xy4a55d","name":"pechal'nyy angel","artist":"dHoq413de"},{"id":"k4H59e8b3","name":"In Love","artist":"GD957395"},{"id":"f7F164954","name":"Pianoboy","artist":"Fo992be2"},{"id":"nndUfM68e0b","name":"纯音乐流行歌曲钢琴版","artist":"yium2pbea72"},{"id":"04OLcf56a5","name":"葛顺·梦钢琴","artist":"kiKhdI47043"},{"id":"kxqXd3eb8","name":"Fly Away","artist":"OVu8f41c"},{"id":"gdCh7d7e0","name":"눈꽃송E","artist":"bZEQ2594e"},{"id":"kbykcb679","name":"Annabelle","artist":"Fo992be2"}],"artists":[{"id":"bP6s23881","name":"Richard Clayderman"},{"id":"bVOF36f72","name":"David Garrett"},{"id":"cIJp2d833","name":"Maksim Mrvica"},{"id":"Fo992be2","name":"Pianoboy"},{"id":"dLpI3eae1","name":"The Piano Guys"},{"id":"bKJWrm94589","name":"钢琴曲qing"},{"id":"Ehd1246","name":"郎朗"},{"id":"dHoq413de","name":"Игорь Крутой"},{"id":"WiS9ed04","name":"Paul Mauriat"},{"id":"bkwyb41ff","name":"V.K克"},{"id":"Gpu8d7fd","name":"吉田兄弟"},{"id":"Yez1514e","name":"Mantovani"}]},{"type":"style","id":"719","name":"轻音乐流行 Light Pop","description":"轻音乐，是指那种风格轻松、活泼的音乐，它是能给人以愉悦和抒情感，优美动听、通俗易懂的音乐。所谓“轻”，是指与庄重的严肃音乐对比而言。舞曲、进行曲、小夜曲比奏鸣曲、交响曲要“轻”；轻歌曲、抒情歌曲、诙谐歌曲比大合唱、清唱剧要轻；喜歌剧要比正剧要“轻”。形象地说，它是音乐中的轻武器，和文学里的小品文、笑话、抒情诗等大致相同。轻音乐作品的旋律优美动听、清晰流畅，节奏鲜明轻快，音色丰富多彩，深受人们喜爱。\n\nEasy Pop is a strand of easy listening that relies on light arrangements of pop hits.

Unlike jazz, which demands your utmost attention, easy listening slips into the background, which is the very reason many critics and listeners dismissed the music as nothing more than disposible fluff. Although some records certainly fall into that category, there were a number of inventive arrangers and conductors working in the genre, such as Martin Denny, Les Baxter and Esquivel, who distinguished themselves with unpredictable instrumentation and idiosyncratic arrangements. Still, the primary characteristic of easy listening, from Ray Conniff's lush wordless vocals to the Latin flourishes of Herb Alpert, is that it's pleasant and easy on the ears.","songs":[{"id":"mQDzjB50cd4","name":"Skyfall","artist":"dSoV491e5"},{"id":"mQMHk283625","name":"Empire of Angels","artist":"bEjsfd811"},{"id":"dCd6l29f0e","name":"Never Say Goodbye","artist":"bMpW1f3ed"},{"id":"mTaizU5e91b","name":"思乡","artist":"9dgluueb7c8"},{"id":"xNQn8ic944d","name":"春日","artist":"nnFfs3b7aa3"},{"id":"b6PjZdb14d","name":"On the Beautiful Blue Danube","artist":"Z4ld755d"},{"id":"QSxJ5401f","name":"A Night at the Opera: Hallelujah Chorus/With Cat-Like Tread/Symphony No.","artist":"d59E3c3e3"},{"id":"b6Pzidc9ee","name":"Water Music","artist":"Z4nada51"},{"id":"xLs1AT9f881","name":"An Der Schönen Blauen Donau Op.314","artist":"AKw86a89"},{"id":"8ItFwmf57b3","name":"紧张音乐","artist":"bjqa98944"},{"id":"bqveDKY384d7","name":"El Condor Pasa","artist":"dcvE39fc0"},{"id":"b64KIdcc7a","name":"Love Theme","artist":"9cT62cf5"}],"albums":[{"id":"g4qa5f7fa","name":"Skyfall","artist":"dSoV491e5"},{"id":"8ISsRpf7cdf","name":"Sun","artist":"bEjsfd811"},{"id":"se6J1f5e1","name":"River of Dreams: The Very Best...","artist":"bMpW1f3ed"},{"id":"yhUCAha4bad","name":"探秘火星","artist":"9dgluueb7c8"},{"id":"rIjA21635","name":"More Hooked On Classics","artist":"d59E3c3e3"},{"id":"oArtfa420","name":"The Greatest Video Game Music","artist":"ZRebd12f"},{"id":"fWKB4d419","name":"Eighty Not Out","artist":"AKw86a89"},{"id":"nnj5vC8faff","name":"音为陶笛（17373044730）","artist":"9dksyE1c697"},{"id":"5wdU36fa8","name":"60 Wereldsuccessen","artist":"AKw86a89"},{"id":"fhFI51f22","name":"Plays Popular Classics","artist":"Z4nada51"},{"id":"fhEz92dc3","name":"Time Warp","artist":"Z4ld755d"},{"id":"yhVyg8af9cb","name":"春日","artist":"nnFfs3b7aa3"}],"artists":[{"id":"Yez1514e","name":"Mantovani"},{"id":"Z4ld755d","name":"Erich Kunzel"},{"id":"9dgluueb7c8","name":"爱乐汇轻音乐团"},{"id":"Yfnb7dab","name":"101 Strings Orchestra"},{"id":"biohb0802","name":"Frank Chacksfield"},{"id":"Yeyd4a13","name":"Percy Faith"},{"id":"7kf8f797","name":"Ray Conniff"},{"id":"AgJ6267c","name":"Bert Kaempfert"},{"id":"GpZ74687","name":"東京フィルハーモニー交響楽団"},{"id":"bz5lf66ad","name":"Boston Symphony Orchestra"},{"id":"bAIs18ceb","name":"Canadian Brass"},{"id":"Yetbcbfc","name":"Boston Pops Orchestra"}]},{"type":"style","id":"725","name":"器乐独奏 Solo Instrumental","description":"Solo Instrumental  器乐独奏\n这种音乐通常是音乐家们经由民间音乐激发的灵感而创作，其演绎通常是纯乐器，如钢琴、吉他、塞尔特的竖琴纯乐器，甚至还有铸打成的洋琴。这种音乐直接促成了Windham Hill和Narada这样的成功的新世纪音乐厂牌，而这些厂牌又在其发展中将这种音乐导向印象主义的方向。这种音乐中有不少作品是颇具创新的，并且也非常感人。只是到后来，有些二流的音乐机会主义分子混进来，结果使得这种音乐落了个“听觉壁纸”这么个名声，当然，一些出色的音乐艺人仍一直在向人们展示着这种音乐的真实所在。\nSolo Instrumental recordings launched successful labels like Windham Hill and Narada, ushering in a whole movement oriented toward impressionistic, often folk-inspired originals for piano, guitar, Celtic harp, and even hammered dulcimer.

Fresh、霍迪尼乐团、Warp 9、肥胖男孩及Spoonie Gee。一般认为The Sugarhill Gang1979年的歌曲《Rapper's Delight》是第一首在主流音乐界广为流行的嘻哈音乐。1980年代的嘻哈音乐开始分化，发展出更复杂的音乐风格。在1980年代以前，嘻哈音乐主要局限在美国。不过嘻哈音乐在1980年代开始变成许多国家音乐风格中的一部分。\n\n新学派嘻哈是嘻哈音乐的第二波，起源于1983–84年Run DMC及LL Cool J早期的专辑。黄金年代嘻哈是指1980年代中期到1990年初之间一段创新的年代。著名的艺人有Juice Crew、全民公敌乐团、Eric B & Rakim、Boogie Down Productions、KRS-One、EPMD、Slick Rick、野兽男孩、Kool G Rap、Big Daddy Kane、Ultramagnetic MCs、De La Soul及A Tribe Called Quest等。\n\n帮匪说唱是嘻哈音乐中的一种，强调的是巿中心年轻人的暴力生活型态以及其贫穷的生活条件。Schoolly D、N.W.A、Ice-T、Ice Cube及Geto Boys是建立帮匪说唱风格的艺人。其最为人知的是混合有政治及社会评论的政治说唱及帮匪说唱中的犯罪故事及犯罪元素。\n\n在西海岸嘻哈中，G-funk自1990年代起就主导了主流的嘻哈音乐。1990年代初期至中期的东海岸嘻哈是由非洲中心的爵士说唱及Native Tongues的另类嘻哈主导，而当时硬核说唱也相当流行，艺人有纳斯、武当帮及声名狼藉先生。\n\n1990年代的嘻哈音乐开始和美国各地的音乐风格融合，例如南部嘻哈及亚特兰大嘻哈，同时嘻哈音乐也和其他的流行音乐风格同化，例如新灵魂乐。嘻哈音乐是1990年代中间最畅销的音乐风格之一，流行风潮到21世纪仍延续著。嘻哈音乐也持续在主流音乐发挥影响力。在美国也看到一些相关类型音乐的成功，例如强调节奏及音乐多于歌词内容的旷课乐。不过自2005年起，嘻哈音乐的销售量严重的下滑，在2000年代中期，因为像OutKast及肯伊·威斯特等跨界音乐人的成功，另类嘻哈仍在主流音乐中占有一席之地。 2000年代末直到2010年代初期，小韦恩、Soulja Boy、巴比瑞等人是最受欢迎的饶舌乐手。2010年代，许多歌手像是德雷克、妮姬·米娜、 杰寇以及肯德里克·拉马尔皆取得巨大的商业成功。此时陷阱音乐团体或歌手，如Migos及未来小子也受到欢迎。\n\nRap's germination is sometimes attributed to the righteous street poetry of the Last Poets and the Watts Prophets, but it didn't begin to take full shape — and earn its tag — until after the Sugarhill Gang released \"Rapper's Delight\" in 1979. Since then, rap spread from its New York epicenter throughout the remainder of the U.S. (with each region taking on its own specific flavor) and then to countless countries. Rap's core components are beats and rhymes, but that simplicity belies the wide range of sounds that have sprung from them. Instrumentalists, a sampled breakbeat, or a drum machine can form the backbone of a track, while an arrangement can be spaciously spare or chaotically dense, and a chorus can range from atonal shouting to a sweet melody. Detractors were still calling rap a fad in 1985, when LL Cool J released his first single. They were doing the same thing when, roughly 20 years later, the same MC released his tenth album, and they'll probably continue to do so as long as the genre exists. Should rap ever die, which isn't likely, it would be far too late to prevent its effect on most other music forms, from R&B to rock to jazz.","songs":[{"id":"JC8tSP1e1b5","name":"全部都是你","artist":"bC7kneU4b140"},{"id":"8FZzTIf624b","name":"Luv Letter","artist":"bfEIb0c67"},{"id":"U58WMc26848","name":"Flower Dance","artist":"bfEIb0c67"},{"id":"mQ5N2S942da","name":"Love the Way You Lie","artist":"btg6f9a42"},{"id":"M1xi6460d","name":"Apologize","artist":"6kd4f392"},{"id":"b1MJfb9a0","name":"不得不爱","artist":"e2Q6ba6c"},{"id":"mQBNb66e0af","name":"Whistle","artist":"bzNmefe21"},{"id":"U5JazG25e3d","name":"Timber","artist":"9Lp4eeb0"},{"id":"xLsRYqacaf2","name":"A Little Story","artist":"b7mee85ad"},{"id":"xLFSLY160db","name":"迷途羔羊","artist":"ihyffebb"},{"id":"xNfXhpad57d","name":"Papillon","artist":"yhD0G6c8316"}],"albums":[{"id":"nndKUE74035","name":"全部都是你","artist":"bC7kneU4b140"},{"id":"sYoO202f4","name":"贫民百万歌星","artist":"1O70324"},{"id":"jZSea7221","name":"Recovery (Deluxe Edition)","artist":"btg6f9a42"},{"id":"jNMLc699c","name":"Mirror","artist":"bfEIb0c67"},{"id":"jENxac229","name":"差不多先生","artist":"1O70324"},{"id":"yhZnyka983b","name":"野狼disco","artist":"nnArZF4f128"},{"id":"beAGt6O322bd","name":"Fresh Game","artist":"dSyy45e76"},{"id":"jPt5aeae3","name":"Time...","artist":"GD957395"},{"id":"xaAv6wcf47c","name":"The Marshall Mathers LP 2","artist":"btg6f9a42"},{"id":"r4971fe00","name":"Curtain Call: The Hits","artist":"btg6f9a42"},{"id":"nmTy586f70d","name":"天兵","artist":"nmSuuc56d23"},{"id":"fUry981c9","name":"A Cup Of Coffee","artist":"bfEIb0c67"}],"artists":[{"id":"8xO82fe0","name":"BIGBANG"},{"id":"btg6f9a42","name":"Eminem"},{"id":"cPNxKec8cab","name":"吴亦凡"},{"id":"bfEIb0c67","name":"DJ OKAWARI"},{"id":"b6EJf5801","name":"G-Dragon"},{"id":"1O70324","name":"MC HotDog热狗"},{"id":"h4WRv633520","name":"防弹少年团"},{"id":"bzNmefe21","name":"Flo Rida"},{"id":"m3x2SZe9830","name":"Jony J"},{"id":"UWCdfaad","name":"The Black Eyed Peas"},{"id":"IzX64886","name":"Nicki Minaj"},{"id":"mpvzIO8faca","name":"T-T"}],"styles":[{"type":"style","id":"1353","name":"嘻哈 Hip-Hop","description":"嘻哈音乐（英语：Hip-hop Music，也叫做hip-hop或rap music），是一种跟着伴奏、带着韵律吟诵（饶舌）的音乐风格，诞生于美国1970年代，并于1980年代成为大众流行文化之一。该音乐所用的伴奏多产生于音乐取样手段，亦被称作“嘻哈音乐”，两者均诞生于广义的嘻哈文化。该文化包含了司众（饶舌）、控盘（刮碟）、歇段舞（霹雳舞）和涂鸦等几种街头艺术。\n\n嘻哈音乐及嘻哈文化首先在1970年代美国贫民区的青年中出现，其中大多数是纽约的美国黑人。当时纽约的街区聚会越来越盛行，尤其是在南布朗克斯特别盛行。DJ会在街区聚会中播放流行歌曲的打击乐。嘻哈音乐一开始出现，当时的音乐取样技术及鼓机都已容易取得，且价格不贵。唱盘技术随着歇段间奏（breaks）一起发展，配合牙买加式的Deejay唱法。饶舌是演出者依照乐器或是合成的节拍念词的演出方式。这个阶段的嘻哈称为旧学派嘻哈，著名的艺人有DJ库尔·贺克、闪耀大师与狂暴五人、妙手佛迪、马尔雷·马尔、Afrika Bambaataa、Kool Moe Dee、克帝斯·布罗、Doug E. Fresh、霍迪尼乐团、Warp 9、肥胖男孩及Spoonie Gee。一般认为The Sugarhill Gang1979年的歌曲《Rapper's Delight》是第一首在主流音乐界广为流行的嘻哈音乐。1980年代的嘻哈音乐开始分化，发展出更复杂的音乐风格。在1980年代以前，嘻哈音乐主要局限在美国。不过嘻哈音乐在1980年代开始变成许多国家音乐风格中的一部分。\n\n新学派嘻哈是嘻哈音乐的第二波，起源于1983–84年Run DMC及LL Cool J早期的专辑。黄金年代嘻哈是指1980年代中期到1990年初之间一段创新的年代。著名的艺人有Juice Crew、全民公敌乐团、Eric B & Rakim、Boogie Down Productions、KRS-One、EPMD、Slick Rick、野兽男孩、Kool G Rap、Big Daddy Kane、Ultramagnetic MCs、De La Soul及A Tribe Called Quest等。\n\n帮匪说唱是嘻哈音乐中的一种，强调的是巿中心年轻人的暴力生活型态以及其贫穷的生活条件。Schoolly D、N.W.A、Ice-T、Ice Cube及Geto Boys是建立帮匪说唱风格的艺人。其最为人知的是混合有政治及社会评论的政治说唱及帮匪说唱中的犯罪故事及犯罪元素。\n\n在西海岸嘻哈中，G-funk自1990年代起就主导了主流的嘻哈音乐。1990年代初期至中期的东海岸嘻哈是由非洲中心的爵士说唱及Native Tongues的另类嘻哈主导，而当时硬核说唱也相当流行，艺人有纳斯、武当帮及声名狼藉先生。\n\n1990年代的嘻哈音乐开始和美国各地的音乐风格融合，例如南部嘻哈及亚特兰大嘻哈，同时嘻哈音乐也和其他的流行音乐风格同化，例如新灵魂乐。嘻哈音乐是1990年代中间最畅销的音乐风格之一，流行风潮到21世纪仍延续著。嘻哈音乐也持续在主流音乐发挥影响力。在美国也看到一些相关类型音乐的成功，例如强调节奏及音乐多于歌词内容的旷课乐。不过自2005年起，嘻哈音乐的销售量严重的下滑，在2000年代中期，因为像OutKast及肯伊·威斯特等跨界音乐人的成功，另类嘻哈仍在主流音乐中占有一席之地。 2000年代末直到2010年代初期，小韦恩、Soulja Boy、巴比瑞等人是最受欢迎的饶舌乐手。2010年代，许多歌手像是德雷克、妮姬·米娜、 杰寇以及肯德里克·拉马尔皆取得巨大的商业成功。此时陷阱音乐团体或歌手，如Migos及未来小子也受到欢迎。","songs":[{"id":"JC8tSP1e1b5","name":"全部都是你","artist":"bC7kneU4b140"},{"id":"b1MJfb9a0","name":"不得不爱","artist":"e2Q6ba6c"},{"id":"xNfXhpad57d","name":"Papillon","artist":"yhD0G6c8316"},{"id":"mSuvKL79fa3","name":"不用去猜","artist":"m3x2SZe9830"},{"id":"mSIYUP90684","name":"Good Night","artist":"yiusYqd7e8f"},{"id":"mSGjjef02e1","name":"7538 (Me U - SanE Remix)","artist":"nn92Jf7a0c7"},{"id":"JDo1qd22904","name":"We Young","artist":"nnB6oN73738"},{"id":"mQ3xTo51d28","name":"Toss It Up","artist":"b6lref6f7"},{"id":"xN2Nigc9ffa","name":"BINGBIAN病变","artist":"9cywuSe7d51"},{"id":"mQ74yy8630d","name":"Super Mario","artist":"e6ca66d"},{"id":"mQVMWM8bfdd","name":"Dat $tick","artist":"yhDziKbc65d"}],"albums":[{"id":"nndKUE74035","name":"全部都是你","artist":"bC7kneU4b140"},{"id":"yhZnyka983b","name":"野狼disco","artist":"nnArZF4f128"},{"id":"d8495cc4","name":"高手","artist":"bLk2d77a"},{"id":"iLhfc21c","name":"Wu Ha","artist":"bLk2d77a"},{"id":"9cAkgKf48eb","name":"Papillon","artist":"yhD0G6c8316"},{"id":"bqHF3z35a19c","name":"Feel & Sight","artist":"8JNWiHe4c01"},{"id":"yhUp8p12c73","name":"We Young","artist":"nnB6oN73738"},{"id":"d89861a7","name":"我的麦克风","artist":"bLk2d77a"},{"id":"yhU7VDe15e5","name":"NCT #127 Regular-Irregular - T...","artist":"yhD3Abda5b5"},{"id":"beMaH91307da","name":"你所不知道的杜振熙之内部整修","artist":"bgqsdcca4"},{"id":"USkL7w2a8d1","name":"We Go Up -The 2nd Mini Album","artist":"nngvMa856b6"},{"id":"nttoeaf32","name":"Will's 未来式","artist":"bLk2d77a"}],"artists":[{"id":"8xO82fe0","name":"BIGBANG"},{"id":"cPNxKec8cab","name":"吴亦凡"},{"id":"bfEIb0c67","name":"DJ OKAWARI"},{"id":"b6EJf5801","name":"G-Dragon"},{"id":"1O70324","name":"MC HotDog热狗"},{"id":"h4WRv633520","name":"防弹少年团"},{"id":"UWCdfaad","name":"The Black Eyed Peas"},{"id":"IzX64886","name":"Nicki Minaj"},{"id":"mpvzIO8faca","name":"T-T"},{"id":"6iz5d08a","name":"Akon"},{"id":"bfLeddd3b","name":"2NE1"},{"id":"dSyy45e76","name":"顽童MJ116"}]},{"type":"style","id":"231","name":"流行说唱 Pop Rap","description":"流行说唱/Hip-Hop 是适合电台广播的说唱，主要特点是吸引人的旋律与节奏、干净利落的制作，以及噱头的推广，这种风格也称“干净说唱”。相当于用说唱的形式在流行音乐中演唱，主题大多为情感，爱情等主流音乐主题，音乐编曲也更为主流化，可以说是流行音乐对于嘻哈文化的一种借鉴。艺术家包括Will Smith , MC Hammer 和 Young M.C 等，尽管常受硬核说唱者嘲弄，但因注意年轻人的市场而不断掀起强力热潮。\n\nPop-Rap is a marriage of hip-hop beats and raps with strong melodic hooks, which are usually featured as part of the chorus section in a standard pop-song structure. Pop-rap tends to be less aggressive and lyrically complex than most street-level hip-hop, although during the mid- to late '90s, some artists infused the style with a more hardcore attitude in an attempt to defuse backlash over their accessibility. Pop-rap got its start in the late '80s, when artists like Run-D.M.C., L.L. Cool J, and the Beastie Boys began to cross over into the mainstream. Shortly thereafter, rappers like Tone Loc, Young MC, and DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince recorded singles emphasizing their good-humored storytelling abilities, to massive chart success; a number of other, mostly singles-oriented acts followed in their wake with similarly good-natured party tunes and novelties. With the possibility of popular acceptance very real, other artists -- around the same time -- began to play up rap's connection to R&B and dance music. This latter group often relied on samples to supply their melodies, and with the 1990 explosion of MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice, pop-rap was often derided (and, occasionally, taken to court) for its willingness to borrow hooks from well-known hit songs without altering those appropriations very much, if at all. This gave the style a not entirely deserved bad reputation, since many '90s artists continued to score big pop hits while developing their own distinctive sounds (PM Dawn, Naughty by Nature, House of Pain, Arrested Development, Coolio, Salt-N-Pepa, Sir Mix-a-Lot, etc.). Meanwhile, Dr. Dre's catchy G-funk and Puff Daddy's Hammer-esque plundering of '80s pop hits helped bring gangsta and hardcore themes to the top of the charts; by the end of the '90s, pop-rap was dominated by artists they had influenced and/or mentored, as well as artists who blended rap with urban soul.","songs":[{"id":"JC8tSP1e1b5","name":"全部都是你","artist":"bC7kneU4b140"},{"id":"M1xi6460d","name":"Apologize","artist":"6kd4f392"},{"id":"mQBNb66e0af","name":"Whistle","artist":"bzNmefe21"},{"id":"U5JazG25e3d","name":"Timber","artist":"9Lp4eeb0"},{"id":"xLFSLY160db","name":"迷途羔羊","artist":"ihyffebb"},{"id":"xNfXhpad57d","name":"Papillon","artist":"yhD0G6c8316"},{"id":"8Gi4kAf3809","name":"轻熟女 27","artist":"yhOfrrb063a"},{"id":"cqsXJeff02","name":"Right Now (Na Na Na)","artist":"6iz5d08a"},{"id":"8Goxp2f4427","name":"Fancy","artist":"eDey95359"},{"id":"mSq2wv5cc4d","name":"無限的我 (무한적아; Limitless)","artist":"yhD3Abda5b5"},{"id":"xLIbz4b5a21","name":"Worth It","artist":"kblnCn47bca"}],"albums":[{"id":"nndKUE74035","name":"全部都是你","artist":"bC7kneU4b140"},{"id":"sYoO202f4","name":"贫民百万歌星","artist":"1O70324"},{"id":"jENxac229","name":"差不多先生","artist":"1O70324"},{"id":"beAGt6O322bd","name":"Fresh Game","artist":"dSyy45e76"},{"id":"nmTy586f70d","name":"天兵","artist":"nmSuuc56d23"},{"id":"yhO8W2109b6","name":"NCT#127 LIMITLESS - The 2nd Mi...","artist":"yhD3Abda5b5"},{"id":"fYB87X27d3a","name":"The New Classic","artist":"eDey95359"},{"id":"9czQVQfa6c5","name":"NCT #127 - The 1st Mini Album","artist":"yhD3Abda5b5"},{"id":"jcv0a3b86","name":"Shock Value","artist":"bvbV1714d"},{"id":"nmTTnk8fa87","name":"H","artist":"xLLCPdd5f3b"},{"id":"JXk0OG213fa","name":"你的男孩","artist":"mpvzIO8faca"},{"id":"diMlwObd5b6","name":"쿠데타 [COUP D'ETAT]","artist":"b6EJf5801"}],"artists":[{"id":"8xO82fe0","name":"BIGBANG"},{"id":"btg6f9a42","name":"Eminem"},{"id":"cPNxKec8cab","name":"吴亦凡"},{"id":"b6EJf5801","name":"G-Dragon"},{"id":"1O70324","name":"MC HotDog热狗"},{"id":"h4WRv633520","name":"防弹少年团"},{"id":"bzNmefe21","name":"Flo Rida"},{"id":"m3x2SZe9830","name":"Jony J"},{"id":"UWCdfaad","name":"The Black Eyed Peas"},{"id":"IzX64886","name":"Nicki Minaj"},{"id":"mpvzIO8faca","name":"T-T"},{"id":"bLk2d77a","name":"潘玮柏"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3285","name":"陷阱说唱 Trap Rap","description":"陷阱说唱（Trap Rap）起源于美国南部的亚特兰大，是说唱音乐的一个重要分支，也是目前最为流行的说唱风格，它吸收了美国南部流行音乐旋律性极好的特点同样也受到陷阱舞曲（Trap Music）的启发与影响，在听觉上加了很多“冲击效果”的硬式新型舞曲，比如有些低音bass特别沉闷，有些节奏速度快beats又重，还有和声带有迷幻空间感等等。\n\nForm of hip hop characterized by beats with high-pitched synthesizers (often imitating brass or orchestral tones) and hard, frequently polyrhythmic 808 drum machine lines at moderate to slow tempos with fast hi-hats as counterpoints.

Hardcore rap is tough, streetwise, intense, and often menacing (although the latter isn't always the case; there is room for humor and exuberance as well). Gangsta rap is the style most commonly associated with hardcore rap, but not all hardcore rap revolves around gangsta themes, even though there is a great deal of overlap, especially among hardcore rappers of the '90s. The first hardcore rap came from the East Coast during the late '80s, when artists began to move away from party rhymes and bragging about their microphone skills; their music and language began to reflect the gritty, often harsh urban surroundings in which it was usually created and enjoyed. Before any specific formula for gangsta rap had been invented, artists like New York's Boogie Down Productions and L.A.'s Ice-T were committing detailed observations of street life to tape; plus, Public Enemy's chaotic sound collages were setting new standards for production power, and N.W.A. celebrated the bleakness of the ghetto and the gangsta lifestyle with an over-the-top machismo. In the early '90s, hardcore rap was essentially synonymous with West Coast gangsta rap until the 1993 emergence of the Wu-Tang Clan, whose spare, minimalistic beats and haunting string and piano samples became a widely imitated style. With its slamming, hard-hitting grooves and street-tough urban grit, hardcore rap became hip-hop's most popular crossover style during the latter half of the '90s, its subject matter now a mix of party anthems, gangsta's money/sex/violence obsessions, and occasional social commentary. Artists like the Notorious B.I.G., DMX, and Jay-Z became platinum-selling superstars, and Master P's brand of gangsta-oriented Southern hardcore also became a lucrative commercial force, even if it didn't produce crossover hit singles on the same level.","songs":[{"id":"mQ5N2S942da","name":"Love the Way You Lie","artist":"btg6f9a42"},{"id":"mQ3WcP717fa","name":"Empire State of Mind ","artist":"d1ql3cabc"},{"id":"mQ8M1k80cc5","name":"Lighters","artist":"bnsW9d962"},{"id":"8GgQXhfa436","name":"Peso","artist":"iPr8aaa63"},{"id":"OLDp7d617","name":"Disco Inferno","artist":"dStS497a4"},{"id":"JBoR1H24f6e","name":"Broccoli","artist":"JuOnyR241bc"},{"id":"UlaP5206d","name":"Dangerous","artist":"dAEK3dfba"},{"id":"b1qeAj03ea4e","name":"DAY LOVE NIGHT","artist":"8vQVJw176d8"},{"id":"fbgK7cd13","name":"Ghetto Gospel","artist":"yqa466ab"},{"id":"OITb7847c","name":"Lollipop","artist":"Vaia89a7"},{"id":"b1hHXaa7d9","name":"You Know How We Do It","artist":"3eN69d30"}],"albums":[{"id":"jZSea7221","name":"Recovery (Deluxe Edition)","artist":"btg6f9a42"},{"id":"xaAv6wcf47c","name":"The Marshall Mathers LP 2","artist":"btg6f9a42"},{"id":"r4971fe00","name":"Curtain Call: The Hits","artist":"btg6f9a42"},{"id":"bmtGa1473","name":"The Marshall Mathers LP","artist":"btg6f9a42"},{"id":"fDZQ5c511","name":"The Blueprint 3","artist":"TfJd9799"},{"id":"sj4Y1e8e6","name":"Relapse","artist":"btg6f9a42"},{"id":"gdPf50b1a","name":"Hell: The Sequel","artist":"bnsW9d962"},{"id":"MsN7b53d","name":"The Eminem Show","artist":"btg6f9a42"},{"id":"eUxu819e8","name":"Get Rich or Die Tryin'","artist":"dStS497a4"},{"id":"jg6vd0c3c","name":"The Massacre","artist":"dStS497a4"},{"id":"hBPXxI2ff25","name":"Magna Carta...

Still, even if Dre's patented G-funk defined the West Coast sound and style for many, California's rap scene was a great deal more diverse. Up until the mid- to late '80s, West Coast rap mostly imitated East Coast party rap, already considered old-school in its place of origin; however, both Los Angeles and the Bay Area soon proved to be fertile pastures. The former produced the landmark proto-gangsta recordings of Ice-T, the hugely influential, Latino-tinged stoner funk of Cypress Hill, and the warped comedy of the Pharcyde; the Bay Area countered with the pimp-obsessed rhymes of TOO|$HORTToo $hort, the P-Funk-inspired, good-humored Digital Underground, and the pop breakthrough of MC Hammer. In short, West Coast rap became as eclectic and difficult to pigeonhole as East Coast rap. However, N.W.A.'s 1989 gangsta-rap landmarkStraight Outta Compton set the stage for a more identifiable West Coast style — its sound was hard-hitting and minimalistic, its lyrics alternating between violent hedonism and righteously angry social commentary. Upon leaving N.W.A., Ice Cube made solo records which maintained that lyrical tone while employing noisy, Public Enemy-style production; his bandmate Dr. Dre discovered Snoop Doggy Dogg, signed to Death Row Records, and at the end of 1992 released The Chronic, the album that defined G-funk and spawned legions of imitators. The Chronic's gangsta hedonism and production style — whiny synthesizers, rolling P-Funk beats, and deep, slow grooves — provided the blueprint that made Death Row the biggest hip-hop label of the early '90s, scoring hits by Snoop, Warren G.,Tha Dogg Pound, and more. Controversial gangsta star 2Pac joined the label in late 1995 and became a crossover superstar with theDre duet \"California Love,\" and Coolio had taken a more pop-oriented version of the West Coast sound to the top of the charts earlier in the year with \"Gangsta's Paradise.\" However, West Coast dominance soon crumbled — 2Pac was murdered in 1996, Drejumped ship, and Death Row CEO Suge Knight was jailed over business practices. By the end of the '90s, hip-hop's focus had turned back to the East Coast and to the emerging South.","songs":[{"id":"ONlH933a3","name":"Remember the Name","artist":"dSvz49cc3"},{"id":"xNcEXgd728d","name":"HUMBLE.","artist":"OaR5b708"},{"id":"fbjb55d19","name":"Life Goes On","artist":"yqa466ab"},{"id":"LjDr961cb","name":"Still D.R.E.","artist":"TfAb7bd6"},{"id":"mQ8ijo8db7d","name":"Sweat (Radio Edit)","artist":"3ffe8727"},{"id":"mSM3HGa23f9","name":"Taste","artist":"GcVb50ea"},{"id":"8GxF28ec127","name":"4EVER","artist":"Ju0ak91fb37"},{"id":"b1hHXaa7d9","name":"You Know How We Do It","artist":"3eN69d30"},{"id":"8GouVmf3d8f","name":"Studio","artist":"eiy44a05b"},{"id":"8Ispdaf18b0","name":"This Is America","artist":"NuC90e83"},{"id":"bCkA09H491c9","name":"Titties (Bonus)","artist":"A1z6d3da"}],"albums":[{"id":"bCu019f9f","name":"2001","artist":"TfAb7bd6"},{"id":"4fxe38d80","name":"The Rising Tied","artist":"dSvz49cc3"},{"id":"b1CwGOx3de2f","name":"DAMN.","artist":"OaR5b708"},{"id":"tfsL24cff","name":"Good Kid, M.A.A.D.

All of rap's most important early artists were based in the New York City area — old-school legends like DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, the Sugarhill Gang, Kurtis Blow, and Run-D.M.C. As rap grew and became more diverse over the course of the '80s, productive scenes began to spring up in other locations around the country; nonetheless, East Coast rap dominated through most of the '80s. Although the sound of East Coast rap wasn't completely uniform, from the mid- to late '80s it tended to gravitate to more aggressive beats and sample collages, and many MCs prided themselves on their technical dexterity in crafting lyrics. In other words, with some exceptions East Coast rap became a music intended more for intense listening than for the dancefloor, helping develop the genre into a respected art form as it grew more elaborate and complex. Typifying this golden era of the East Coast sound were artists like Eric B. & Rakim, Boogie Down Productions, and Slick Rick, all of whom boasted immense lyrical skill rooted in old-school style, as well as the harder-hitting sounds of EPMD and Public Enemy. Also based on the East Coast were the Native Tongues, a collective of positive, Afrocentric artists assembled by Afrika Bambaataa; while De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, the Jungle Brothers, and other, mostly New York-based groups had a major impact on hip-hop in the late '80s, they were more readily identified with their musical eclecticism than any specific geographic location. N.W.A's 1989 album Straight Outta Compton served notice that the West Coast had toughened its sound to go along with its already gritty, street-level subject matter; combined with West Coast rap's ability to retain its primary function as party music, this helped make it the dominant force in hip-hop during the '90s. The rise of Southern rap further ensured that East Coast rap could no longer dominate as it once had, but the '90s were hardly a wash for the region. In addition to Puff Daddy's hugely lucrative, pop-accessible Bad Boy label, the East Coast produced its share of varied, highly acclaimed artists, including lyrical virtuoso Nas, the eclectic Fugees and Roots, and the hugely influential hardcore unit Wu-Tang Clan.","songs":[{"id":"mQ3WcP717fa","name":"Empire State of Mind ","artist":"d1ql3cabc"},{"id":"8GgQXhfa436","name":"Peso","artist":"iPr8aaa63"},{"id":"OLDp7d617","name":"Disco Inferno","artist":"dStS497a4"},{"id":"b9Fz49f897","name":"Dance with My Father","artist":"bdVDd1f3c"},{"id":"PGlq74a70","name":"Street Life","artist":"bxQbf4512"},{"id":"QwUC68ca6","name":"香港 Superstar","artist":"baxcc8040"},{"id":"cmYXnf5ba2","name":"Star Cry ","artist":"4Xl8bd43"},{"id":"mQXRql67e6b","name":"Panda","artist":"bfMFumo2e9a8"},{"id":"LjAu8cb3f","name":"Get It on the Floor","artist":"c9jl4b8dc"},{"id":"NRd77cd2f","name":"Hip Hop Is Dead","artist":"UYBd70af"},{"id":"8FZux4ede95","name":"My Time","artist":"YfDb189a"}],"albums":[{"id":"fDZQ5c511","name":"The Blueprint 3","artist":"TfJd9799"},{"id":"eUxu819e8","name":"Get Rich or Die Tryin'","artist":"dStS497a4"},{"id":"jg6vd0c3c","name":"The Massacre","artist":"dStS497a4"},{"id":"hBPXxI2ff25","name":"Magna Carta...

Old school is easily identified by its relatively simple raps — most lines take up approximately equal amounts of time, and the rhythms of the language rarely twisted around the beats of the song. The cadences usually fell squarely on the beat, and when they didn't, they wouldn't stray for long, returning to the original pattern for quick resolution. The emphasis was not on lyrical technique, but simply on good times — aside from the socially conscious material of Grandmaster Flash, which greatly expanded rap's horizons, most old-school rap had the fun, playful flavor of the block parties and dances at which it was born. In keeping with the laid-back, communal good vibes, old-school rap seemed to have more room and appreciation for female MCs, although none achieved the higher profile ofGrandmaster Flash & the Furious Five or the Sugarhill Gang. Some old-school songs were performed over disco or funk-style tracks, while others featured synthesized backing (this latter type of music, either with or without raps, was known as electro). Old-school rap's recorded history begins with two 1979 singles, Fatback's \"King Tim III\" and the Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight,\" although the movement had been taking shape for almost a decade prior. Sugarhill Records quickly became the center for old-school rap, dominating the market until Run-D.M.C. upped the ante for technique and hardcore urban toughness in 1983-84. Their sound and style soon took over the rap world, making old-school's party orientation and '70s funk influences seem outdated. When compared with the more complex rhythms and rhyme schemes of modern-day rap — or even the hip-hop that was being produced less than ten years after \"Rapper's Delight\" — old-school rap can sound dated and a little unadventurous. However, the best old-school tracks retain their liveliness as great party music no matter what the era, holding up surprisingly well considering all that's happened since.","songs":[{"id":"mSFvTU89e45","name":"Finesse (Remix)","artist":"czwe26824"},{"id":"xL2Gvmae8bd","name":"空","artist":"cVLYO09ce9d"},{"id":"mQRbwD8045e","name":"杀死差不多先生","artist":"b50218a16"},{"id":"mSuOTU612f8","name":"诗人说梦(prod.

On That Other Level”以及1990年的专辑《The Geto Boys》，还有1991年的“We Can't Be Stopped”的成功。在他们星途大展之时，休斯敦开始成为南部嘻哈的中心。迈阿密也在南部嘻哈的兴起中扮演了重要角色，同时期兴起的知名艺人有2Live Crew、Uncle Luke等。\n\n90年代，亚特兰大成为南部嘻哈运动的中心城市。如OutKast、Goodie Mob之类的组合在很大程度上帮助南部成为嘻哈乐的一个发展中心。OutKast成员Big Boi和Andre 3000成为专辑销量能和东海岸和西海岸的说唱大腕们媲美的南部艺人。南部最为成功的厂牌则出自90年代中后期的新奥尔良。该市的嘻哈乐吸收了本地特色的Bounce音乐。这种形式最早出现在80年代末纽约说唱组合Showboyz的“Triggerman”一曲中。Cash Money唱片公司、No Limit唱片公司以及已经倒闭的Big Boy唱片公司造就了南方说唱厂牌的商业成功。他们的艺人唱片销量以百万计，并且在嘻哈圈内也获得很高的赞誉。在21世纪初，来自南方的艺人开始涌现。如T.I.、Lil Flip、卢达克里斯、Nappy Roots、Trick Daddy、Trina以及Trae都在这一时期出现在主流音乐界。2004年，OutKast以其专辑《Speakerboxxx/The Love Below》获得六项格莱美奖，其中包括最佳专辑奖。\n\nLong a third wheel to the East Coast and West Coast hip-hop scenes, Southern Rap emerged in the '90s as a fertile scene unto itself, particularly in Miami, New Orleans, and Atlanta. In the late '80s, Southern rap was primarily associated with Miami bass music, also popularly known as \"booty rap\" both for its rump-shaking grooves and the central preoccupation of its lyrics. Chief among its artists was Luther Campbell's 2 Live Crew, which took the sexual content of its lyrics to a hard-partying extreme, provoking outcries from pro-censorship forces across the country. The sound of Miami bass spread through the rest of the South and remained a national dance-floor staple through the '90s, with artists like Tag Team, 95 South, the 69 Boyz, Quad City DJ's, and Freak Nasty all scoring huge hit singles (albeit with lyrics far less explicit than Campbell's). Atlanta had its share of bass-heavy party rap artists, but also offered a quirkier, more distinctive (and critically acclaimed) style incorporating the funk of classic Southern soul. The cerebral Arrested Development was the first to hit the national scene in 1992, and they were followed a few years later by protégés of the harder-edged Organized Noize production squad, most notably OutKast and Goodie Mob. If Atlanta was the creative center of Southern rap, New Orleans was surely its commercial center. Master P built a lucrative empire with No Limit record label, and even if he and his roster didn't really push the envelope artistically -- most No Limit albums stuck to West Coast G-funk, Wu-Tang-style hardcore, and nothing but straight-up gangsta lyrics -- No Limit pumped out product with assembly-line efficiency and became a constant presence on the national album charts during the late '90s. Toward the end of the decade, fellow New Orleans label Cash Money and its house producer Mannie Fresh -- whose distinctive approach reworked the Southern bass sound -- scored a national breakout with Juvenile, establishing them as a legitimate rival force.","songs":[{"id":"RfZi58cdc","name":"Low","artist":"bzNmefe21"},{"id":"xLJroMde67b","name":"Black Beatles","artist":"9cyn2Zfc726"},{"id":"fDBSY3dca6","name":"Whatever You Like","artist":"4Zq8f620"},{"id":"mQVTLI7f216","name":"Without You(DZ&PS￥.P)[Prod.Breezy]","artist":"URUvEW2661c"},{"id":"JBoR1H24f6e","name":"Broccoli","artist":"JuOnyR241bc"},{"id":"xLGAbaa38d0","name":"Colorful World","artist":"yhDyQed9107"},{"id":"JAPGnq20976","name":"How To Love ","artist":"Vaia89a7"},{"id":"8G1s50ef12d","name":"Low Life","artist":"8a163fcf2"},{"id":"xNd6zR99ddb","name":"Rake It Up","artist":"coiu25fc4"},{"id":"b6im8b37f4","name":"Hip Hop Police","artist":"d46i3c500"},{"id":"cqw2C264c1","name":"Hey You There ","artist":"baJTacc10"}],"albums":[{"id":"nmTAEG8b93b","name":"Higher Brothers","artist":"URUvEW2661c"},{"id":"yhEG70e18fb","name":"SremmLife 2","artist":"9cyn2Zfc726"},{"id":"jvt5b89d3","name":"Mail on Sunday","artist":"bzNmefe21"},{"id":"yhPuNMd1734","name":"Rockstar","artist":"bC6WiiB46232"},{"id":"jExlbb598","name":"Paper Trail","artist":"4Zq8f620"},{"id":"yhE7rQc33a3","name":"Before","artist":"yhDyQed9107"},{"id":"yhEWo6108b6","name":"768Mixtape","artist":"mpvzIO8faca"},{"id":"cErslWd4d24","name":"15/XV","artist":"xv4TsI99a02"},{"id":"jGGJb2cb4","name":"iSouljaBoyTellem","artist":"baJTacc10"},{"id":"o1w0Md3b30","name":"新青年","artist":"bi0cb5ec2"},{"id":"nnc4fb685c3","name":"Big Baby D.R.A.M.","artist":"JuOnyR241bc"},{"id":"yhPa3acf25d","name":"ISSA","artist":"nmS3WW71d9f"}],"artists":[{"id":"bzNmefe21","name":"Flo Rida"},{"id":"9Lp4eeb0","name":"Pitbull"},{"id":"65I70457","name":"Nelly"},{"id":"Vaia89a7","name":"Lil Wayne"},{"id":"4Zq8f620","name":"T.I."},{"id":"URUvEW2661c","name":"说唱会馆"},{"id":"Kt85b6a9","name":"J.

Its first dose of national popularity came in the mid-90s with the extremely fast-paced styles of rappers known as Choppers, such as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (Cleveland), Twista (Chicago), Tech N9ne (Kansas City, Missouri), Atmosphere (Minneapolis, Minnesota), Freddie Gibbs (Gary, Indiana), and Eminem/Slim Shady (Detroit, Michigan).\nHowever, while the artists mentioned above became the first to introduce Midwest hip hop that rivaled the popularity of West and East Coast styles, subsequent acts have since risen to national prominence such as Nelly, D12, Common and Kanye West but they share very few similarities.

UK rap, or speed-toasting, has also been heavily influenced by US hip-hop. British hip hop, particularly that originating from London, was commercially superseded by grime, however, after a post-millennium boom period, the genre remains a hotbed of talent.\nIn 2003, The Times described British hip hop's broad ranging approach:\n\"...'UK rap' is a broad sonic church, encompassing anything made in Britain by musicians informed or inspired by hip-hop's possibilities, whose music is a response to the same stimuli that gave birth to rap in New York in the mid-Seventies.\"","songs":[{"id":"b8eEHaed48","name":"Paper Planes","artist":"b1uPe23f5"},{"id":"b5rvw117ba","name":"American Boy","artist":"7c1611a3"},{"id":"mQ6Ocs7d4dd","name":"Written In the Stars","artist":"biKacc3ef"},{"id":"JC7BHH21b75","name":"Damselfly","artist":"yhDua6c8740"},{"id":"8HMIt3e3356","name":"Big For Your Boots","artist":"gvGkEP28972"},{"id":"b1pTdE9429ba","name":"Mama Do The Hump","artist":"O4P65fa7"},{"id":"mQM3lW5c1f7","name":"Marshall Law","artist":"cfrRRJ653fb"},{"id":"xL9cixd1db4","name":"Be Right Back, Moving House","artist":"bos69f69b"},{"id":"NBc25b71c","name":"Black Connection","artist":"4Yo728b3"},{"id":"b3lJcb9b2e","name":"Fix Up, Look Sharp","artist":"6cu7cac5"},{"id":"mQ9wo2581bf","name":"Last Bongo in Brighton","artist":"boA5c9b88"}],"albums":[{"id":"fpVr5165b","name":"Kala","artist":"b1uPe23f5"},{"id":"mRnXZg57e28","name":"Matangi","artist":"b1uPe23f5"},{"id":"gfw2527f7","name":"Disc-Overy","artist":"biKacc3ef"},{"id":"nvKOfeaf7","name":"Shine","artist":"7c1611a3"},{"id":"nndEbg6f07e","name":"Gang Signs & Prayer","artist":"gvGkEP28972"},{"id":"9c8xFjea564","name":"YOUTH","artist":"biKacc3ef"},{"id":"jcKkada7c","name":"Uptown Saturday Night","artist":"4Yo728b3"},{"id":"diNsbxad903","name":"Demonstration","artist":"biKacc3ef"},{"id":"nndDfif018d","name":"Yesterday's Gone","artist":"yhDua6c8740"},{"id":"gheT7cea9","name":"Music for the Mature B-Boy","artist":"boA5c9b88"},{"id":"ooQqrdcdfd","name":"Everybody Down","artist":"cfrRRJ653fb"},{"id":"m2Zqvp537a0","name":"Shedding Skin","artist":"bos69f69b"}],"artists":[{"id":"b1uPe23f5","name":"M.I.A."},{"id":"biKacc3ef","name":"Tinie Tempah"},{"id":"7c1611a3","name":"Estelle"},{"id":"Oooec22d","name":"Foreign Beggars"},{"id":"cfrRRJ653fb","name":"Kate Tempest"},{"id":"boA5c9b88","name":"DJ Format"},{"id":"dGK8VBf0fc5","name":"Only Real"},{"id":"bos69f69b","name":"Ghostpoet"},{"id":"8yS81d70","name":"Artifacts"},{"id":"bmlNd2823","name":"Wretch 32"},{"id":"bvdz1a92d","name":"Roots Manuva"},{"id":"clfw2a842","name":"Ty"}]},{"type":"style","id":"225","name":"爵士说唱 Jazz Rap","description":"爵士说唱（Jazz Hip Hop）的起源可以追溯到1920年代的爵士乐，随后受1950年代的波普（Bop）和爵士放克（Jazz Funk）、1970年代的爵士融合（Jazz Fusion）、1980年代的说唱（Hip Hop）的影响，爵士说唱（Jazz Hip Hop）——或者说Jazz-rap——作为一种流派终于在1980年代中期出现，标志为Cargo乐队1985年所发行的唱片《Jazz Rap, Volume One》和Stetsasonic在1988年发行的单曲《Talkin' All That Jazz》。\n\n而真正推动Jazz Hip Hop发展的，是东岸说唱传奇A Tribe Called Quest在1991年发行的唱片《The Low End Theory》和爵士大师Miles Davis于1992年发行的唱片《Doo-Bop》，尤其是前者：RIAA认证白金唱片，《滚石》杂志史上500强唱片第154位，曾入选《时代》杂志史上100强唱片。这两张唱片的器乐演奏姿态属于Jazz，但Beats却是Hip Hop风格，演唱方式也为Rap。同时期还有一大批爵士艺术家和Eastcoast Hiphop歌手同样尝试过Jazz Hip Hop音乐，如Herbie Hancock、Digable Planets 、Us3、Naughty by Nature、De La Soul、Camp Lo甚至大名鼎鼎的“街头诗人”Nas等等，由此，Jazz Hip Hop的发展终于在90年代中期走上正轨，这段时期的代表唱片为《Hand on the Torch》、《Illmatic》、《Uptown Saturday Night》。时间跨过千禧年，众多深受Jazzhiphop影响的音乐人开始活跃起来，譬如J. Rawls、Nujabes、Fat Jon、Madlib、Kero One、Kondori等等。\n\n在这里要提一下Nujabes这位日本音乐人，他将Jazzhiphop传播到东方，同DJ Okawari等日本Hiphoper对日本和中国的Underground Hiphop产生了很深的影响，其代表唱片为《Modal Soul》。而在2010年代的今天，Jazzhiphop的故事仍在继续。（以上多处资料出自维基百科，转自http://weibo.com/u/5129710977的编译）\n\nPrecursor：\n（2nd ed. London: Rough Guides, 2005） lists Louis Armstrong's 1925 recording of \"Heebie Jeebies\" in his timeline of hip hop. In the 1970s, The Last Poets, Gil Scott-Heron, and The Watts Prophets placed spoken word and rhymed poetry over jazzy backing tracks. There are also parallels between jazz and the improvised phrasings of freestyle rap. Despite these disparate threads, jazz rap did not coalesce as a genre until the late 80s.\n\nBeginnings of a trend：\nIn 1985, jazz fusion band Cargo, led by Mike Carr, released the single \"Jazz Rap\", appearing on the album Jazz Rap, Volume One [1]. In 1988, Gang Starr released the debut single \"Words I Manifest\", sampling Dizzy Gillespie's 1952 \"Night in Tunisia\", and Stetsasonic released \"Talkin' All That Jazz\", sampling Lonnie Liston Smith. Gang Starr's debut LP, No More Mr. Nice Guy （Wild Pitch, 1989）, and their track \"Jazz Thing\" （CBS, 1990） for the soundtrack of Mo' Better Blues, further popularized the jazz rap style.\n\n\nNative Tongues：\nGroups making up the collective known as the Native Tongues tended toward jazzy releases: these include the Jungle Brothers' debut Straight Out the Jungle （Warlock, 1988） and A Tribe Called Quest's People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm （Jive, 1990） and The Low End Theory （Jive, 1991）. The Low End Theory has become one of hip hop's most acclaimed albums, and also earned praise from jazz bassist Ron Carter, who played double bass on one track. De La Soul's Buhloone Mindstate （Tommy Boy, 1993） featured contributions from Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, and Pee Wee Ellis, and samples from Eddie Harris, Lou Donaldson, Duke Pearson and Milt Jackson.Also of this period was Toronto-based Dream Warriors' 1991 release And Now the Legacy Begins （4th & B'way/Island/PolyGram）. It produced the hit singles \"My Definition of a Boombastic Jazz Style\" and \"Wash Your Face in My Sink\". The first of these was based around a loop taken from Quincy Jones' \"Soul Bossa Nova\", while the second sampled Count Basie's 1967 rendition of \"Hang On Sloopy\". Meanwhile, Los Angeles hip hop group Freestyle Fellowship pursued a different route of jazz influence in recordings with unusual time signatures and scat-influenced vocals.\n\n\nJazz artists come to hip hop：\nThough jazz rap had achieved little mainstream success, jazz legend Miles Davis' final album （released posthumously in 1992）, Doo-Bop, was based around hip hop beats and collaborations with producer Easy Mo Bee. Davis' ex-bandmate Herbie Hancock returned to hipp influences in the mid-nineties, releasing the album Dis Is da Drum in 1994. Jazz musician Branford Marsalis collaborated with Gang Starr's DJ Premier on his Buckshot LeFonque project that same year.\n\n\n1990s–present：\nDigable Planets' 1993 release Reachin' （A New Refutation of Time and Space） was a hit jazz rap record sampling the likes of Don Cherry, Sonny Rollins, Art Blakey, Herbie Mann, Herbie Hancock, Grant Green, and Rahsaan Roland Kirk. It spawned the hit single \"Rebirth of Slick （Cool Like Dat）\". Also in 1993, Us3 released Hand on the Torch on Blue Note Records. All samples were from the Blue Note catalogue. The single \"Cantaloop\" was Blue Note's first gold record.\n\nThis period was the high-water mark for jazz rap's popularity among hip hop listeners, following which it came to be regarded for a time as a trend which was \"played out\". Musical jazz references became less obvious and less sustained, and lyrical references to jazz certainly more rare. However, jazz had been added to the palette of hip hop producers, and its influence continued throughout the 1990s whether behind the gritty street-tales of Nas （Illmatic, Columbia, 1994）, or backing the more bohemian sensibilities of acts such as The Roots and Common Sense. Since 2000 it can be detected in the work of producers such as J. Rawls, Nujabes, Fat Jon, Madlib, Kero One, and the English duo The Herbaliser, among others. A project somewhat similar to Buckshot Le Fonque was Brooklyn Funk Essentials, a New York based collective who also released their first LP in 1994. Prince himself contributed to the genre on some songs from 1991-1992, as well as with his New Power Generation album Gold Nigga, which mixed jazz, funk and hip-hop and was released very confidentially.\n\nOne hip hop project which continued to maintain a direct connection to jazz was Guru's Jazzmatazz series, which used live jazz musicians in the studio. Spanning from 1993 to 2007, its four volumes assembled jazz luminaries like Freddie Hubbard, Donald Byrd, Courtney Pine, Herbie Hancock, Kenny Garrett and Lonnie Liston Smith, and hip hop performers such as Kool Keith, MC Solaar, Common, and Guru's Gang Starr colleague DJ Premier.","songs":[{"id":"U58WMc26848","name":"Flower Dance","artist":"bfEIb0c67"},{"id":"xLsRYqacaf2","name":"A Little Story","artist":"b7mee85ad"},{"id":"mQ8HI4bc428","name":"Refrain","artist":"bjgmc4023"},{"id":"mQ32TG79bba","name":"关于小熊","artist":"bgqsdcca4"},{"id":"b1pNIQD623eb","name":"春よ、来い","artist":"Igg6421c"},{"id":"xLoOQGc8882","name":"Moon Flow","artist":"cvfp283f6"},{"id":"bAlZkb4899","name":"Luv (sic.)pt3","artist":"cMzs328b6"},{"id":"U5DID226d6f","name":"夏恋","artist":"bnmUcf1ee"},{"id":"8Gbj3ae2ad2","name":"Everlasting Truth","artist":"ICG4b6ec"},{"id":"xLtsBjc2890","name":"what for?","artist":"bndiad145"},{"id":"bCkBAB66e523","name":"Butterfly Kiss","artist":"bmoWc2fbd"},{"id":"xLoVCId106b","name":"Righteous Path","artist":"bgRIc99ce"}],"albums":[{"id":"nZZDf422d","name":"收敛水","artist":"bgqsdcca4"},{"id":"gd1G89856","name":"Eternal Light","artist":"bjgmc4023"},{"id":"foK66f6d1","name":"Modal Soul","artist":"bbe6b8fe8"},{"id":"w5tg3e9f9","name":"Smooth Sound Collection 2","artist":"Igg6421c"},{"id":"fD84bfa57","name":"Muziq and Foto","artist":"cvfp283f6"},{"id":"4Tqs391d1","name":"Winter Sweet","artist":"bgqsdcca4"},{"id":"jPsPaed53","name":"Landscape","artist":"GD37b5c4"},{"id":"bfdIdPV342fc","name":"男孩 / A Portrait In Time","artist":"IiP651ce"},{"id":"kupm9eba7","name":"Natural Relax","artist":"bir6b31e4"},{"id":"gbvq8b3ec","name":"courtship","artist":"bndiad145"},{"id":"fEdn8cd97","name":"Alone Journey","artist":"bgRIc99ce"},{"id":"guMy6c655","name":"夏恋","artist":"bnmUcf1ee"}],"artists":[{"id":"bgqsdcca4","name":"蛋堡"},{"id":"bbe6b8fe8","name":"Nujabes"},{"id":"IiP651ce","name":"Lu1"},{"id":"IjN92555","name":"白天不亮"},{"id":"eF6u8ccc9","name":"小老虎"},{"id":"cvfp283f6","name":"Nomak"},{"id":"iT16b9653","name":"Shirfine"},{"id":"bnmUcf1ee","name":"Otokaze"},{"id":"bjgmc4023","name":"Anan Ryoko"},{"id":"Fxr82f55","name":"FreeTEMPO"},{"id":"bgRIc99ce","name":"Blazo"},{"id":"yhDwqec6bf3","name":"StrawberryPapa"}]},{"type":"style","id":"233","name":"喜剧说唱 Comedy Hip Hop","description":"喜剧说唱是 Hip-Hop 的轻松一面，远离硬核与黑帮说唱的攻击性和暴力性的形象，喜剧说唱者在现代城市音乐的低音和敲击中加入了风趣和幽默的独特感觉。\n\nComedy hip hop or comedy rap is a sub-genre of hip hop music that is comedic in nature, often incorporating satirical lyrics.

Eamon is known for his 2004 hit, \"I Love Them Ho's\" in 2004. Rucka Rucka Ali is also an artist who experiments with comedy hip hop while touching on social issues like racism, as in his song, \"I Can Do Whatever I'm White\". \"Weird Al\" Yankovic has made entries to this music genre, along with Nerdcore. \"Thrift Shop\" by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis is also a well known song of comedy hip hop.

It is an umbrella term that groups weirdoes like Ultramagnetic MC's, firebrands like Paris and the Coup, and gangsta rap entrepreneurs who sell mixtapes out of the trunks of their cars.","songs":[{"id":"mQ8M1k80cc5","name":"Lighters","artist":"bnsW9d962"},{"id":"xLy0y1d6286","name":"Thrift Shop","artist":"bnLSaeb88"},{"id":"b5C9u1451e","name":"Crazy","artist":"7Nl76e90"},{"id":"JBoR1H24f6e","name":"Broccoli","artist":"JuOnyR241bc"},{"id":"8Ga9BXe2c5f","name":"Wavin' Flag","artist":"9cn7220b"},{"id":"xLGcJMca886","name":"H.B.U.F","artist":"8WOmfie2314"},{"id":"xL9Z0sc792e","name":"My City","artist":"9c91UFe7ad0"},{"id":"mQUnGI7e533","name":"[Dzknow, TZ, 光光] B A RAP $TAR","artist":"OYw6af97"},{"id":"xLBgpKbc5ed","name":"他眼里有雾 (Prod.by PDP)","artist":"mit0o5eff1"},{"id":"xLFWm2d6214","name":"兰亭集序","artist":"bCvrqmZ4467e"}],"albums":[{"id":"dQKbyce8936","name":"J HOOD Mixtape","artist":"m3x2SZe9830"},{"id":"g45987187","name":"The Heist","artist":"bnLSaeb88"},{"id":"itMmRA3781f","name":"P.E.I Vol.2","artist":"cgbqDW8a91b"},{"id":"gdPf50b1a","name":"Hell: The Sequel","artist":"bnsW9d962"},{"id":"9c81LSf1884","name":"物女金","artist":"m3x2SZe9830"},{"id":"jTFNb7083","name":"Troubadour","artist":"9cn7220b"},{"id":"C9kX45a7f","name":"St. Elsewhere","artist":"7Nl76e90"},{"id":"yhEnLucde2c","name":"莲湖","artist":"nmSrxl4bc90"},{"id":"80dL90f0f38","name":"早期说唱单曲集","artist":"mit0o5eff1"},{"id":"nnc4fb685c3","name":"Big Baby D.R.A.M.","artist":"JuOnyR241bc"},{"id":"bMn7t37b8b8","name":"Special Effects","artist":"d9nq3f4ef"},{"id":"b8mISr9364d","name":"P.E.I_Mixtape1","artist":"cgbqDW8a91b"}],"artists":[{"id":"cgbqDW8a91b","name":"马思唯"},{"id":"URUvEW2661c","name":"说唱会馆"},{"id":"bhMyc5318","name":"幼稚园杀手"},{"id":"m2HMGn87e1d","name":"毛衍七"},{"id":"nftreT7c2a7","name":"法老"},{"id":"cc6LeB54e20","name":"龍胆紫"},{"id":"bqH0klm36706","name":"弹壳"},{"id":"9dfk9o1d635","name":"88rising"},{"id":"bnkCd1daf","name":"Young Mai"},{"id":"buikNB65337","name":"精气神制作"},{"id":"8JNWiHe4c01","name":"王以太"},{"id":"b5Yme6166","name":"新街口组合"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3341","name":"中国地下说唱 Chinese Underground Hip Hop","description":"中国说唱音乐的雏形形成于80年代中期，很多人对于嘻哈文化的启蒙是来自于1984年的美国电影《霹雳舞》（Beat Street）。1984年在北京的俱乐部Juliana's开始有了DJ播放说唱音乐，1992年在北京昆仑饭店的水晶的士高俱乐部里出现了经常性的嘻哈夜现场表演，1994年上海百老汇也出现了嘻哈主题的俱乐部。\n2003年，随着北京Vic's和Mix俱乐部的开业说唱音乐变得更加主流。\n1986年，香港歌手林子祥发表的《Ahlam日记》是一首粤语说唱，跟当时美国80年代流行的old school的说唱风格是非常相似，崔健于1989年发布的专辑《新长征路上的摇滚》中。收录了一首偏摇滚风格的说唱歌曲《不是我不明白》，算是国语Rap的启蒙。\n2002年，来自北京的说唱组合“隐藏”发行了他们的专辑《为人民服务》走进了大众视野。\n美国人Dana Burton在2001年开始举办Iron Mic说唱比赛来推广说唱音乐，这项每年举办的比赛在中国说唱界有着十分重要的位置。\n2017年，随着爱奇艺的网络节目《中国有嘻哈》的播出，许多中国说唱歌手从地下被大众所熟知，中国说唱也在大众文化中逐渐有了属于自己的位置。","songs":[{"id":"mSK5lr5fca2","name":"目不转睛","artist":"8JNWiHe4c01"},{"id":"8HAXoYee584","name":"天干物燥","artist":"bq5T9cW3b608"},{"id":"mQ3ZzE5be2b","name":"莫名我就喜欢你","artist":"b6rD1dd9e"},{"id":"JBga1y24ee1","name":"你我他","artist":"bCvrqmZ4467e"},{"id":"mQRKDo64c46","name":"白日梦想家","artist":"bq5T9cW3b608"},{"id":"mSuOTU612f8","name":"诗人说梦(prod.

France required manpower to sustain its newly booming industries and the governmental solution was the mass immigration of peoples from regions of past French colonial occupation to fill the gaps caused by shortage in personnel. As early as 1945, l'Office national d'immigration (ONI) was formed to supervise the immigration of new workers. Newly arrived Africans were not given the same employment opportunities as their French Caribbean counterparts because they were not citizens and often Africans ended up working as civil servants and menial employees living in dilapidated housing projects. Much of the resistance to social and economic imbalances in French hip-hop relate to this historically unequal situation. This is proved by lyrics of Aktivist's song, \"Ils ont\", The extract when translated states \"Aktivist denounces intolerance to all immigrant fathers/Exploited in France since the 50s-60s/...their bodies are falling apart/And their children are still being judged according to their origins.\"\nMany of the French hip hop artists come from the poor urban areas on the outskirts of large cities known as banlieues (\"suburbs\"). Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Nantes, Lille, Strasbourg, Rennes, Caen, Le Havre, Rouen, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Grenoble and Nice have produced various French hip hop artists. The political and social status of the minority groups living in France have a direct influence on French hip hop.Many French rappers are products of the HLM rent-controlled housing and draw upon their upbringing in this environment as a source of inspiration for their lyrics. France's hip hop scene is, by far, the most active in Europe.","songs":[{"id":"8I4Zbk16a47","name":"玫瑰人生","artist":"9dfLzefef87"}],"albums":[{"id":"yhU299afff0","name":"La vie en rose","artist":"9dfLzefef87"},{"id":"bC7oZ9s4b02b","name":"NO LIE","artist":"9dfLzefef87"},{"id":"qy8fSy54e1f","name":"Way Back Home","artist":"nnJyIT5d748"},{"id":"CodMdUfc977","name":"In Da Club","artist":"nnfHZd4ef65"},{"id":"qyCVfH63ab6","name":"Nouvelle année","artist":"bfNvFJK2f9bd"},{"id":"nn1kGQ8cda9","name":"Days Long Gone","artist":"beEUd02db"},{"id":"NiUgKJ20a73","name":"Sourou 2","artist":"9dgwSHfe8b7"},{"id":"1ttnPb11e95","name":"La machine","artist":"kBdG8n45873"},{"id":"btTg9qQ35c81","name":"Solo","artist":"yi4lhna135f"},{"id":"qy9suH95370","name":"Evolution","artist":"nnAvez92c29"},{"id":"b4NTuj66a034","name":"Joli bébé","artist":"JXPEdB1e418"},{"id":"qyC2GK738ce","name":"Gros bébé","artist":"nnaHkx899bd"}],"artists":[{"id":"dRf4478d8","name":"Guru"},{"id":"ONx5cbae","name":"Sexion d'Assaut"},{"id":"JQxqSj20224","name":"Fuzati"}]},{"type":"style","id":"216","name":"基督教说唱 Christian Hip Hop","description":"基督教说唱就是在 Hip-Hop 节奏上唱出颂赞歌词。起初，Hip-Hop 的都市生活和暴力的主题与现代基督教音乐的和平与轻松似乎无缘。然而，DC Talk, T-Bone 和 Transformation Crusade 发现这两者的混合体是有观众的。MC Hammer 是第一个以明确的基督主题获得成功的说唱乐者；在 20 世纪 90 年代早期，他创作的热门单曲“Pray”把至今仍在萌芽期的基督教说唱介绍给他的广大听众。\n\n Christian hip hop (originally Gospel rap, also known as Christian rap, Gospel hip hop, holy hip hop, or Christ hop) is a form of hip hop music that uses Christian themes to express the songwriter's faith.

The style rose to prominence during the 1980s in Chicago and New York. Hip house originated in Chicago and quickly became popular across the U.S. and in the UK, with tracks like \"Rok Da House\" by UK producers the Beatmasters featuring British female emcees the Cookie Crew.\nMinor controversy ensued in 1989 when a U.S. record called \"Turn Up The Bass\" by Tyree Cooper featuring Kool Rock Steady claimed it was the \"first hip house record on vinyl\". The Beatmasters disputed this, pointing out that \"Rok Da House\" had originally been written and pressed to vinyl in 1986. The outfit then released \"Who’s in the House?\" featuring British emcee Merlin, containing the lines \"Beatmasters stand to attention, hip house is your invention\" and \"Watch out Tyree, we come faster\". More claims to the hip-house crown were subsequently laid down in tracks by Fast Eddie, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, and Toni Scott.","songs":[{"id":"xN9FSYba378","name":"土嗨情歌","artist":"bfNw4M133bdd"},{"id":"xN7bDTb17eb","name":"Lights Off（Prod.Dosgow）","artist":"nnAaEi66c94"},{"id":"mSMl3a4b915","name":"Ice Cream","artist":"erHHRpf60eb"},{"id":"mSMNDo704e0","name":"This Young Man All Ready","artist":"yivqKxd1a59"},{"id":"xLCjiI9a49d","name":"Sitting On Top Of Da World","artist":"yhDq4Cb38f9"},{"id":"8IsjBofc453","name":"C.B.Crew","artist":"JXRhL4328ce"},{"id":"bCmY0pg4a3af","name":"羽毛","artist":"b1wc9R5cf58"},{"id":"xObmkPdd6af","name":"如果没有你","artist":"fbP76C1ecce"},{"id":"8ItXQZea6d9","name":"我的角度","artist":"nnAvf069e16"}],"albums":[{"id":"nnipPI501a5","name":"命脉","artist":"bfNw4M133bdd"},{"id":"9cWTWuf0317","name":"绷锤子","artist":"iQWLcdd48"},{"id":"nnhXp961319","name":"说唱日记","artist":"bfNw4M133bdd"},{"id":"9cDOYNfa9ab","name":"Lights Off","artist":"nnAoc86a84d"},{"id":"9czgby29ee6","name":"Confusion","artist":"yhDq4Cb38f9"},{"id":"9cDQIre3565","name":"Ice Cream","artist":"erHHRpf60eb"},{"id":"nnny4s64c2f","name":"021Wrecks","artist":"JXRn9820f80"},{"id":"yhTU1Jd7ff7","name":"beat1","artist":"b1wc9R5cf58"},{"id":"nnkHyU94572","name":"杨氏祖传蒸汽波","artist":"9cytrOfbe23"},{"id":"yhSXONbd4a2","name":"陈阿发","artist":"yivqKxd1a59"},{"id":"nnlGhR7569e","name":"徽辰耀悦","artist":"fbP76C1ecce"},{"id":"yhYiWza5d2b","name":"Vintage Girl/Chill Verse","artist":"9dk9yZfd110"}],"artists":[{"id":"eDey95359","name":"Iggy Azalea"},{"id":"iOLTb6f8d","name":"Azealia Banks"},{"id":"o8gQn9ae7d","name":"Shamir"},{"id":"yi1O4Tcd379","name":"soo_hyum"},{"id":"yi2k3Oa7e1e","name":"Ajexsy"},{"id":"yi1cDwa4c58","name":"youngstaryst"},{"id":"9dfh4iff1a5","name":"Rollpaper"},{"id":"yi11im9fbe0","name":"Aka单杀"},{"id":"9dgM261bc54","name":"福小姐"},{"id":"nnFOzf72b46","name":"DBL.D"},{"id":"nnGWFH4ffa1","name":"Maxivy"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3232","name":"蹦啪说唱 Boom Bap","description":"Boom Bap是80年代末到90年代中期的old school style beat，Boom Bap是忠于Hiphop最原始的存在。“The Boom”意味着敲击鼓点，而“Bap”意味着敲击外沿。\n\nIn hip-hop music, boom bap is a style of record production. \"Boom bap\" is an onomatopoeia for the drum sounds prominent in boom bap. The term was popularized by the album Return of the Boom Bap.\n\nIt is associated with producers from New York City in the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as DJ Premier, Pete Rock, KRS-One, Ali Shaheed Muhammed, EPMD, Marley Marl, Large Professor, Prince Paul and Scott La Rock. However, it spread far and wide. For example, boom bap is made by People Under the Stairs in Los Angeles and Recordkingz in London. Although it is still made, boom bap is no longer the dominant style of hip-hop production, remaining somewhat prominent in alternative hip hop but rarely appearing in Top 40 hip hop singles. In March 2013, Busta Rhymes claimed his next album would bring the Boom Bap back to hip hop.","songs":[{"id":"xL92b9130ed","name":"背靠背(Feat Regi Chen)","artist":"cHw2mDc06d9"},{"id":"mSF3Yx94dc1","name":"STREET LIVIN'","artist":"UWCdfaad"},{"id":"xN8CVRb15cc","name":"W E T L O O K","artist":"nn9ok84f183"},{"id":"b3QBvc002c","name":"Sound of da Police","artist":"UYz97c92"},{"id":"bf2lbex2d4f4","name":"Sedatives","artist":"yiuy7hb0b99"},{"id":"xLIjf6a2380","name":"Introduction","artist":"8K2Ydue3fb0"},{"id":"mSLJ3Q7e2b0","name":"goinhard","artist":"9dfS31f5e60"},{"id":"xNF9JBda58b","name":"DATMFs In Da Building","artist":"yiuosT9d7d7"},{"id":"8HOWGVf577e","name":"C.H.A.N.G.E.S.","artist":"yhD2Obb2d6f"},{"id":"bf3bH2X3009e","name":"Represent To The Fullest (Remix)","artist":"nmSrIj7b50e"},{"id":"U7NfvH26753","name":"Επιπόλαιος","artist":"yium5wb1493"},{"id":"b1smZrj41023","name":"Last Train To......","artist":"nmSrBZ6b8e9"}],"albums":[{"id":"fOrSOQ25fed","name":"九零不候","artist":"cHw2mDc06d9"},{"id":"nngWnh73b95","name":"STREET LIVIN'","artist":"UWCdfaad"},{"id":"nmTLSW86bdf","name":"Cloudfiles","artist":"8K2Ydue3fb0"},{"id":"yhP7tKcc3d6","name":"Vintage Vibes","artist":"yiuy7hb0b99"},{"id":"vDvO2c9ee","name":"Return of the Boom Bap","artist":"UYz97c92"},{"id":"9cH2M4fb1e1","name":"Represent To The Fullest","artist":"nmSrIj7b50e"},{"id":"nnhN9r83776","name":"crystallinus","artist":"9dfS31f5e60"},{"id":"nniVQ289a54","name":"Vol3: Sky Is The Limiter","artist":"yiuosT9d7d7"},{"id":"nnh8yc80a52","name":"The Actual Proof","artist":"eEev60993"},{"id":"9c9YGpe1e4f","name":"Everythings's Bittersweet","artist":"yhD2Obb2d6f"},{"id":"yhWDLSbe5e5","name":"Echoes From Another Cosmogony","artist":"yium5wb1493"},{"id":"9cDOhffd119","name":"A Little Late","artist":"yhDua6c8740"}],"artists":[{"id":"btg6f9a42","name":"Eminem"},{"id":"OaR5b708","name":"Kendrick Lamar"},{"id":"iREVdaae1","name":"Joey Bada$$"},{"id":"buXA1c58b","name":"Common"},{"id":"5b25cddc","name":"MF DOOM"},{"id":"Xd3ae041","name":"Bahamadia"},{"id":"iS2ma4db0","name":"Danny Brown"},{"id":"yiuqZJ9d65b","name":"Through Da Truth"},{"id":"bSJsSd87ddd","name":"FebrB"},{"id":"9dmiVDed68b","name":"Raw Impulz"},{"id":"9dgKDr18779","name":"Mytee G.

Song)、广播剧(Drama)、印象集(Image Album)、合集(Collection)等。漫画上涉及到的音乐较少，若发行唱片，通常为作品相关的有声读物或广播剧。游戏方面，多数为原声专辑，通常也会收录游戏主题歌等人声歌曲。除了单独发行唱片，一些厂商会把音乐作为特典内容(BONUS CD)放入商品(动画BD/DVD、游戏软件等)里进行出售以便能有更好的销量，这种做法在最近几年变得流行起来，但也有一定的弊端。\n\nACG音乐在日本唱片业有着比较重要的地位，如《Macross》、《ONE PIECE》、《银魂》、《轻音少女》等系列作品创造了唱片百万级的销量，一些Anisong歌手也因为唱过某些歌曲而家喻户晓。日本ACG音乐影响着本土唱片工业的发展，而未来唱片工业的发展也关乎着日本ACG音乐的命运。","songs":[{"id":"bf2h7hE32785","name":"イベント

Its principal component is that of the electric guitar, but its amplified aspect can extend to the bass (usually a solid body Fender type model, but sometimes merely an old \"slappin''' acoustic with a pickup attached), harmonica, and keyboard instruments. Stylistically, the form is a wide open field, accessible to just about every permutation possible -- embracing both the old, the new, and sometimes futuristic, and something that falls between the two. Some forms of it copy the older styles of urban blues (primarily the Chicago, Texas, and Louisiana variants) usually in a small combo format, while others head into funk and soul territory. Yet electric blues is elastic enough to include artists who pay homage to those vintage styles of playing while simultaneously recasting them in contemporary fashion. It is lastly a genre that provides a convenient umbrella for original artists of late '40s and early '50s derivation who seemingly resist neat classifications.","songs":[{"id":"KmYY5f394","name":"Wonderful Tonight","artist":"SEIbc3e7"},{"id":"cjTzPfd5b4","name":"Ain't No Sunshine","artist":"c9pt3409a"},{"id":"b9ezdc08b1","name":"See That My Grave Is Kept Clean","artist":"Tmp9be73"},{"id":"K0Zt970c5","name":"Mary Had a Little Lamb","artist":"2N35466a"},{"id":"MLvv6ea1f","name":"Slabo Day","artist":"4Ey505a3"},{"id":"fFhCC423df","name":"My Babe","artist":"c9qf4fe28"},{"id":"xL5exxc4be7","name":"花房姑娘","artist":"P5Y71dae"},{"id":"b16oX990b4","name":"Snatch It Back and Hold It","artist":"3mS579f7"},{"id":"chaCuef7f4","name":"Smokestack Lightnin'","artist":"3kZ6f684"},{"id":"b5nxub4619","name":"Trying to Keep It Real","artist":"WWQce962"},{"id":"cl87Jea11c","name":"Don't Pass Me By","artist":"XDk9cea9"},{"id":"xLruV8c5077","name":"It Hurts Me too","artist":"bsJ4ebf8f"}],"albums":[{"id":"Dub80a44","name":"Slowhand","artist":"SEIbc3e7"},{"id":"Oui7bef0","name":"Bring 'Em In","artist":"c9pt3409a"},{"id":"nIZr1ccb8","name":"One Kind Favor","artist":"Tmp9be73"},{"id":"bfnGbcf48","name":"Texas Flood","artist":"2N35466a"},{"id":"Dus54759","name":"Riding with the King","artist":"SEIbc3e7"},{"id":"OSE7c447","name":"Hoodoo Man Blues","artist":"3mS579f7"},{"id":"O4d5176c","name":"Live at the Regal","artist":"Tmp9be73"},{"id":"Ov56adc7","name":"I'm John Lee Hooker","artist":"TlP12cb9"},{"id":"fAeb733fe","name":"The Best of Little Walter","artist":"c9qf4fe28"},{"id":"npGve68ba","name":"In the Skies","artist":"4Ey505a3"},{"id":"eTHi6fbf8","name":"女人的歌","artist":"f5Fae6fd"},{"id":"gzHf744ab","name":"Tempest","artist":"SFQbc0bd"}],"artists":[{"id":"c9pt3409a","name":"Buddy Guy"},{"id":"cLQ7339a4","name":"弥藏"},{"id":"bJp620b58","name":"Muddy Waters"},{"id":"TlP12cb9","name":"John Lee Hooker"},{"id":"SOJcf4a8","name":"Johnny Winter"},{"id":"4Ey505a3","name":"Peter Green"},{"id":"c9qf4fe28","name":"Little Walter"},{"id":"3lx63d7a","name":"Freddie King"},{"id":"yhDwRGd4da7","name":"北京不靠谱乐队"},{"id":"TlQ149dd","name":"Lightnin' Hopkins"},{"id":"3kF8d879","name":"Ronnie Earl"},{"id":"bbGo1439d","name":"Byther Smith"}]},{"type":"style","id":"87","name":"三角洲布鲁斯 Delta Blues","description":"三角洲布鲁斯（Delta Blues）是布鲁斯音乐最早出现的风格之一。 它发源于密西西比三角洲,一片有着肥沃土地，但同时却很贫穷的区域。在Delta Blues中，最明显的特征是滑棒吉他（Slide Guitar）的使用。同时，口琴和雪茄盒吉他（Cigar Box Guitar）也是常常被使用的乐器。演唱的风格从自省到深情到热烈再到激昂都有。Delta Blues也被认为是乡村布鲁斯（Country Blues）的一个区域性演变。和其他早期的布鲁斯音乐一样，它的歌词主要是普通百姓对当时生活环境（如监狱、农场、工厂等）和状况的倾诉。\n\n特征\n一些学者认为Delta Blues在音乐性、在本质上和其他地区的布鲁斯没有太多差别。但是它也有着一些特别的演奏和编曲方式，比如单调低沉的E弦、 平衡的三弦、节奏中的平滑音和圆滑音，对节奏感的强调。滑棒吉他是它的重要特征，而口琴则在其他布鲁斯风格中也很普遍。相对于音乐性，Delta Blues发源地的独特地域性（密西西比是Blues的发源地之一）则更加被人津津乐道。\n\n流行时段\n1920年代末出现以来，虽没有大范围流行，但是在各个年代都有一批音乐人坚守。\n\n英文简介\nThe Delta Blues style comes from a region in the southern part of Mississippi, a place romantically referred to as \"the land where the blues were born.\" In its earliest form, the style became the first black guitar-dominated music to make it onto phonograph records back in the late '20s. Although many original Delta blues performers worked in a string-band context for live appearances, very few of them recorded in this manner. Consequently, the recordings from the late '20s through mid-'30s consist primarily of performers working in a solo, self-accompanied context. The form is dominated by fiery slide guitar and passionate vocalizing, with the deepest of feelings being applied directly to the music. Its lyrics are passionate as well, and in some instances remain the highest flowering of blues songwriting as stark poetry. The form continues to the present time with new performers working in the older solo artist traditions and style.(By Allmusic)","songs":[{"id":"fApua43085","name":"Tamacun","artist":"bzeFe4cf2"},{"id":"eRM5m39a34","name":"Homework","artist":"TlP12cb9"},{"id":"ch1PSe4420","name":"Mannish Boy","artist":"bJp620b58"},{"id":"mQ3tu791f1a","name":"Cross Road Blues","artist":"Tmkd4340"},{"id":"b4cyD9e7db","name":"Washington D.C.

Adding drums, bass, and piano (sometimes saxophones) to the basic string band and harmonica aggregation, the style created the now standard blues band lineup. The form was (and is) flexible to accommodate singers, guitarists, pianists, and harmonica players as the featured performer in front of the standard instrumentation. Later permutations of the style took place in the late '50s and early '60s, with new blood taking their cue from the lead guitar work of B.B.

Blues）是指的从美国传入英国后发展的布鲁斯音乐。在1950年代末至1960年代初，早期的British Blues严格遵照美国布鲁斯音乐的原型依葫芦画瓢，这也是为了向那些布鲁斯前辈致敬。而到了1960年代中期的布鲁斯音乐复兴时期，英国的由Eric Clapton为代表的一批吉他手们开始尝试革新，将 B.B. King、Albert King和Freddie King音乐中的热情的吉他弦和放到极致的拾音器结合，也慢慢演变为后来的布鲁斯摇滚（Blues Rock），也让the Rolling Stones和Eric Clapton等布鲁斯音乐人成为巨星。\n\n特征\n和1950年代发迹的老摇滚（Rock&Roll）不同，British Blues与摇滚乐有更加紧密直接的联系。也正是它将传统风味变为流行市场的主流。\n\n流行时段\n1960-1970年代\n\n英文简介\nMore than a mere geographical distinction, the early British Blues of the late '50s and early '60s paid strict adherence to replicating American blues genres, with an admiration for its originators bordering on reverence. But by the time of the blues revival of the mid-'60s, British guitarists -- in the main led by Eric Clapton -- were starting to bend the form to create their own amalgam. Wedding the string-bending fervor of the B.B., Albert, and Freddie King styles to the extreme volume produced by large amplifiers, British blues largely coalesced into blues rock, with formerly traditional blues artists like the Rolling Stones and Clapton becoming rock stars. The British style has perhaps the closest ties to rock music as opposed to rock & roll, a distinct stylistic descendant of the 1950s. It is this constant shift between preserving older styles and mainstreaming it into the pop marketplace that is the hallmark of British blues.(by

known as Texas blues has encompassed a number of style variations over the decades, but its longest-lasting and most developed is its electric incarnation. This change in the region's sound came after World War II, bringing with it a fully electric style -- largely pioneered by T-Bone Walker -- that featured jazzy, single-string soloing over predominantly horn-driven backing. The style stayed much the same throughout the 1950s, but started moving toward a smaller combo, sans horn section, as the decade moved on. But as much of an uptown sound as Electric Texas Blues represented, its juke-joint roadhouse roots were never too far below the surface, with artists like Lightnin' Hopkins, Juke Boy Bonner, Hop Wilson, and Frankie Lee Sims rocking the joint in duo and trio formats with a frightening intensity. The style moved away from the larger horn-led sounds to smaller and smaller combo formats, eventually embracing much of the same instrumentation as the electric Chicago style, with even more emphasis placed on the lead guitar work. The genre stays current and thriving with a spate of regional performers primarily working in small combo contexts, with a great many of them hailing from the Austin area.\n\nElectric Texas blues is a genre of blues that, although named after the geographic location of its origin, is not bound to that region. It has its roots in Acoustic Texas Blues, from which it developed since the invention of the electric guitar. Notable Electric Texas Blues artists are T-Bone Walker and Freddie King. \n\nSome characteristics that distinguish it from other genres are the notable jazz-influences such as swing rhythms, extensive single string guitarsoloing and often the addition of a horn section to the group.","songs":[{"id":"coEA2ee5e4","name":"Why Are People Like

kick，即使用两面低音鼓或一面低音鼓配双踏板）及/或blast beat，并表现出无调性，节奏切换较多。死亡金属起源于二十世纪八十年代中期，其音乐结构继承自激流金属及早期黑金属。杀手乐队（ Slayer）、缔造者（Kreator）、凯尔特霜冻（Celtic Frost）、毒汁（Venom）等乐队对于这一风格的形成起到了至关重要的作用，而着魔（Possessed）、死亡乐队（Death）、生死讣（Obituary）、尸体乐队（Carcass）、弑神者（Deicide）、食人尸（Cannibal Corpse）、病态天使（Morbid Angel）等乐队则是这一风格的先驱者。八十年代末九十年代初，Combat、Earache、Roadrunner等知名厂牌开始签约死亡金属乐队，旗下的此类乐队数量迅速增长，这使得死亡金属这一风格得到了更多的媒体关注。至今，死亡金属已演变出了多种子风格，包括旋律死亡金属、技术死亡金属，并与其他风格融合衍生了一系列风格，例如死核、死碾、黑暗死亡金属、厄运死亡等等。\n\n(虾米编译自wiki)","songs":[{"id":"mQGJdR92ba7","name":"You

这类乐队中冗长而致幻的即兴表演，那些带有致幻剂色彩的金属和酸性摇滚成分被过滤成早期流行分支的 grunge 风格的那种嗡嗡声。Stoner metal 可以是装模作样而有自知之明的，能够唤起污秽与零乱的，甚或是一种泰然自若的对以往的回顾。无论如何，像 Monster Magnet 和 Kyuss 那样的乐队，完美地契合了90年代早期另类金属运动的电子乐口味。即使是在 grunge 风格已经褪色，而工业和 hip-hop 的影响也开始加诸于另类金属的时候，stoner metal 依然是进入新世纪以来深受推崇的一种风格。\n\nStoner metal is a subgenre of metal music that combines elements of doom metal with elements of psychedelic rock and blues rock to create a melodic yet heavy sound. Like stoner metal's close relative genre stoner rock, riffs are often groovy and psychedelic, while the tempo of the music as a whole is generally slow to mid paced. The guitar tuning is kept low and, unlike stoner rock, there is an additional emphasis on a bass-heavy sound. This form of music was first pioneered in the early 1990s by such bands as Kyuss, Sleep, and Cathedral.\nSeveral of the genre's earliest establishers shared a common characteristic in that both band members and fans alike were frequent marijuana users. This fixation on cannabis, which can also be found within the lyrics of many songs, when combined with the heavy and psychedelic sound of the music gave the genre its now defining nickname as stoner metal. Due to the similarities in styles, some stoner metal bands will borrow and incorporate certain aspects of sludge and vice versa.","songs":[{"id":"bf02jO42e089","name":"My God Is The Sun","artist":"4or8ec3e"},{"id":"8GfNaJ17465","name":"Forget To Remember","artist":"8kg5f434"},{"id":"8Gaz2Kf12f5","name":"New Fang","artist":"H6h585de"},{"id":"mQGlJe4b9f0","name":"Keep Moving","artist":"mfzFY873ab9"},{"id":"NNJE6a864","name":"Petrified","artist":"Us5bf249"},{"id":"xLpqRqd8ce6","name":"New Moon Rising","artist":"60l95f83"},{"id":"mQ84jp9629c","name":"Demon Cleaner","artist":"bsIV1a87e"},{"id":"bCnrtrt44f18","name":"Street Pisser","artist":"9dlASl1c611"},{"id":"8GeytNf660e","name":"Number Thirteen","artist":"G7P5cc60"},{"id":"bqvlml95abd9","name":"Deconstruction","artist":"bw9l16a71"},{"id":"b3K23a6113","name":"River of Soul","artist":"4r970741"},{"id":"mSMbOV73453","name":"Marijuanaut's Theme","artist":"4rF69cd1"}],"albums":[{"id":"xnjJ6Cc90cc","name":"...Like Clockwork","artist":"4or8ec3e"},{"id":"oeXff8f5e","name":"Them Crooked Vultures","artist":"H6h585de"},{"id":"jRXBb6b9b","name":"Cosmic Egg","artist":"60l95f83"},{"id":"jacUc0270","name":"Be Forewarned","artist":"Us5bf249"},{"id":"koyAb1fb8","name":"Welcome to Sky Valley","artist":"bsIV1a87e"},{"id":"yhWuXfb36c5","name":"Plight","artist":"9dlASl1c611"},{"id":"nml01d8c1","name":"The Obsessed","artist":"4r970741"},{"id":"jhZz1366f","name":"あくまのうた","artist":"FeR909fa"},{"id":"C5UK452e2","name":"Master of Brutality","artist":"bwRre2b88"},{"id":"jH6rd2732","name":"Stone Age Complication","artist":"4or8ec3e"},{"id":"gQA2Ge32ab3","name":"Keep Moving","artist":"mfzFY873ab9"},{"id":"yhSPVacea6f","name":"The Sciences","artist":"4rF69cd1"}],"artists":[{"id":"butufa2d9","name":"Electric Wizard"},{"id":"60l95f83","name":"Wolfmother"},{"id":"4rF69cd1","name":"Sleep"},{"id":"cOVO1a9a8f1","name":"Electric Lady"},{"id":"dz7C6701f","name":"Earth"},{"id":"bsIV1a87e","name":"Kyuss"},{"id":"Us5bf249","name":"Pentagram"},{"id":"Us7bfa87","name":"Saint Vitus"},{"id":"4r970741","name":"The Obsessed"},{"id":"6kz5feb2","name":"I Shalt Become"},{"id":"bx30f151b","name":"Pelican"},{"id":"bM8v1f191","name":"Earthless"}]},{"type":"style","id":"875","name":"黑金属 Black Metal","description":"黑金属（英语：Black metal）是在重金属音乐中一个分支流派。黑金属的曲风特色总体来説，运用尖叫式的黑腔、强烈失真的吉他、猛烈却阴沉的双大鼓、快速行进的节奏和旋律，给人冷冽、黑暗、带有绝望的感受。\n\n黑金属流派初期的代表乐团包含Bathory、Mercyful Fate、Hellhammer、Celtic Frost和Venom。这些乐团的根基建立在鞭笞金属（英语：Thrash metal）流派上。直到1980年代到1990年代早期又有所谓第二波黑金属在挪威出现，像是Darkthrone和Mayhem乐团。尽管没有明确的第三波黑金属定义，但是现代黑金属乐队的曲风和歌词上对比起老的黑金属乐队，吸收了很多其他音乐风格的元素。\n黑金属具有很强烈的反主流意识，主要是因为许多乐队的厌世感和反基督教态度。同时，少数黑金属乐队因爲和焚毁教堂、杀人和国家社会主义的紧密关系而闻名。黑金属音乐总体来説是一个地下音乐流派，因爲和主流品味背道而驰以及多数黑金属音乐人的低调处世态度。\n\n黑金属的表现形式\n\n1.黑金属使用的乐器上除了传统的吉他贝斯鼓外，黑金属的分支流派交响黑金属经常会使用电子合成器以及其他的古典乐器像是钢琴，小提琴，大提琴或者是歌剧的女高音。\n\n2.现代黑金属音乐的最主要特征是高失真吉他进行的反复扫弦，同时极少使用吉他独奏（solo）；鼓的方面大多数乐队使用双大鼓连踩（或是双踏），以及小鼓、双面钹（Hi-hat）、定音钹（Ride）的连击，有些乐队特别是单人乐队经常在录音时使用鼓机来代替真鼓。\n\n3.多数黑金属乐队的主唱使用尖利的黑嗓进行歌唱，与死亡金属使用的死嗓不同之处在于，黑嗓的发声方式更爲靠近两颚。早期黑金属乐队的歌词基本上都是有关反基督，凟神和撒旦崇拜，而后期的黑金属乐队的歌词内容则丰富很多，包括厌世、自杀、反人类、虚无主义、神秘学、宇宙、国家社会主义、纳粹、战争、奇幻等内容；而与此相对应，极少数的黑金属乐队的歌词内容则是关于基督和圣经。\n\n黑金属的分支流派\n\n原始黑金属(Raw Black Metal)\n自杀黑金属(Depressive Black Metal)\n交响黑金属(Symphonic Black Metal)\n旋律黑金属(Melodic Black Metal)\n维京黑金属(Viking Black Metal)\n异教黑金属(Pagan Black Metal)\n民谣黑金属(Folk Black Metal)\n纳粹黑金属(National Socialist Black Metal)\n\nBlack metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, shrieked vocals, highly distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, blast beat drumming, raw recording and unconventional song structures.\n\nDuring the 1980s, several thrash metal bands formed a prototype for black metal. This so-called \"first wave\" included bands such as Venom, Bathory, Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. A \"second wave\" arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by Norwegian bands such as Mayhem, Burzum, Darkthrone, Immortal and Emperor. The early Norwegian black metal scene developed the style of their forebears into a distinct genre. Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles with no connection to the Norwegian one.\n\nInitially a synonym for \"Satanic metal\", black metal has often been met with hostility from mainstream culture, mainly due to the misanthropic and anti-Christian views of many artists. Moreover, several of the genre's pioneers have been linked with church burnings and murder. Some artists have also been linked to neo-Nazism, although most black metal fans and most prominent black metal artists shun Nazism and oppose its influence on the black metal subculture.Much like punk, the black metal community generally condemns the seeking of mainstream success or attention, preferring the genre to remain underground.","songs":[{"id":"8Gd7kNee539","name":"Moonlight

Waylander，Cruachan，Vintersorg，Finntroll和Elvenking。\n\n毋庸置疑，Skyclad被公认为民谣金属的先导者，但当时并未开始流行起来，直至90年代中期至末期出现了 Cruachan、Otyg 及 Windir 带动民谣金属的潮流。东欧成了很多具民谣色彩黑金属乐团的发源地，如著名的Graveland和Nokturnal Mortum。乐团Bathory更首先发表专辑如Hammerheart，带来了将维京神话、历史元素注入民谣金属的议论。 后来 Amon Amarth沿袭Bathory的特色,但用另一种曲风演绎，成了一支旋律死亡金属的乐团。一些乐团虽把民谣金属的特色加入歌词上，但普遍并不被承认为民谣金属类。\n\n(百度百科)","songs":[{"id":"xLyn3ub4114","name":"Whalesong","artist":"HCV76949"},{"id":"ckN6Bf0239","name":"Inis Mona

Metal\"。\n\n到了80年代中早期，来自英美的乐团对于厄运金属的独特形态贡献良多。在1982年，英国厄运金属拓荒者乐团Pagan Altar跟Witchfinder General分别发表了他们的首张专辑Volume 1、Death Penalty。在1984到1985年间，三支美国乐团也发表了首张专辑，Saint Vitus发行了Saint Vitus，Trouble发表了Psalm 9，Pentagram发行了Relentless。同时，瑞典的重金属乐团Candlemass也在1986年的首张专辑Epicus Doomicus Metallicus展现了他们的权威。还有在1984发表Day of Retribution专辑的Nemesism，都将厄运金属这个名称更加发扬。\n\n史诗厄运\n史诗厄运金属〈Epic Doom〉在最初是一种较重视主唱声音的厄运金属音乐，主唱的声线是史诗厄运的代表，包括使用清腔、歌剧腔、或是唱诗；歌词则是取材自神话或幻想，但鼓却是用夸张的方式来呈现。然而，区别传统厄运金属跟史诗厄运金属是有困难的。代表性乐团有：Candlemass、Solitude Aeturnus、Solstice、Doomsword等。\n\n迷幻厄运\n迷幻厄运〈Stoner Doom〉是一种加入迷幻金属元素的音乐，迷幻厄运较注重于贝斯低音或吉他的毛燥破音，迷幻金属可视为一个比迷幻摇滚更重、更慢的重金属音乐。代表性乐团有：Kyuss、Sleep、Acid King、Electric Wizard、Son of Otis等。\n\n(维基百科)","songs":[{"id":"MdPt823df","name":"To Blossom

metal、neo-metal、nü-metal、aggro-metal。它保留了传统重金属音乐中失真的音色和极端的音量，并在其中混合了嘻哈节奏、说唱和更具旋律性的主音部分；新金属音乐的音色与重金属相比，其实更加生猛和原始，因为新金属的吉他部分，不像是在重金属音乐中那么复杂，和占据那么重要的位置。\n\n新金属乐队在1990年早期，就开始在美国进行表演，但新金属音乐作为一种风格，露面于主流乐界却是在1994年晚期到1995年早期的事情了。最早在美国国内闯出名堂的新金属乐队，是“科恩”（Korn）乐队和“盲音”（Deftones）乐队。“科恩”乐队的首张专辑《Korn》，其中充斥着大量从重金属音乐,朋克风中吸收来的吉他扫弦和失真音色，这种生猛、撕破脸式的作风，与传统重金属音乐讲究的繁复、高难度的主音吉他形成了鲜明的对比，同时新金属在节奏上更具跳舞性。这种新的风格吸引了大量已经对“涅槃”（Nirvana）乐队的Grunge风格进行简单模仿的乐坛感到厌倦的年轻听众。在科恩乐队之后，“盲音”乐队迅速推出了专辑《肾上腺素》（Adrenalin）。“盲音”成立于1988年，原本其实是一支传统的重金属乐队，1990年，乐队开始改变自己的音色，接受了嘻哈音乐的影响，在歌词中加入了说唱的部分。这种节奏强烈、融合嘻哈和说唱、吉他编排直来直去的音乐风格，在日后成为了新金属风格的核心特色。其他操练着同样风格的乐队，在“盲音”之后，也迅速得到了美国国内音乐市场的注意。在二十一世纪，由Linkin Park为代表的新金属继续前行，人气极佳，每张唱片更是卖到了几百几千万张。\n\n新金属其实是一个十分笼统的名词，有广义和狭义之分。广义的新金属包含了九十年代兴起的几乎所有的新派重型音乐形式，包括Metalcore、Rap-Metal、Industrial-Metal等等；而狭义的新金属指的仅仅是说唱金属。由于这种广义和狭义的分辨不清，导致很多和说唱毫无关联的乐队被一些不了解新金属的朋友误认为是说唱金属。Nu-Metal，从权威媒介的解释上来看，本意是指暴怒金属，与传统重金属相比多了乐团成员灌输音乐其中的愤怒、狂暴元素在里面，而团员们借以表达这种思想的媒介又各不相同，借助core、Rap、Industrial等等。以至于这种类型的音乐夹杂的音乐元素、风格过于丰富，所以直到现在新金属也并没有成为一种独立的音乐风格。至于大多数朋友所持有的将新金属定义为说唱金属的观点是一种误区。这也许是因那些名气相对而言较大的新金属乐团很多都将他们的音乐渗透以说唱所致吧。\n\n(百度百科)","songs":[{"id":"em4gz4da05","name":"Numb","artist":"WhLb3425"},{"id":"r8Th1e2e5","name":"镜子中","artist":"fYabb37c"},{"id":"LKMO6f9ad","name":"Behind

The music is usually slow to mid paced with rare blast beat usage, without any abrupt changes and generally features slowly developing, sometimes repetitive melodies and riffs, thus providing another notable distinction from its parent and other Black Metal sub-genres.

Blackgaze was pioneered by bands associated with a French musician Neige (most notably Alcest and Amesoeurs). They were influenced by Atmospheric Black Metal classics such as Ulver, Burzum and Summoning, as well as non-metal genres like Post-Punk and Neoclassical Darkwave.\n\nThe blackgaze sound is a mixture of black metal aesthetics with more dreamy and mellow textures. One of the main characteristics of the genre are tremolo picking riffs creating an ethereal wall of sound, which is softer than usual black metal and resembling Shoegaze (hence the name). Other common features are rapid blast beats and shrieking vocals, often interchanging with slower sections, clean singing and acoustic or Post-Rock-like instrumental breaks.\n\nOther important blackgaze performers include Lantlôs, Woods of Desolation, and Deafheaven, whose critically acclaimed album Sunbather is one of the most successful and popular records representing the genre.\n\nBecause of its post-rock leanings, the genre is commonly referred to as \"post-black metal\". However, that term can also mean several different styles, e.g. the Norwegian scene of Avant-Garde Metal artists rooted in black metal (Solefald, Arcturus, Ved Buens Ende, etc.).","songs":[{"id":"xLqlzCcc30f","name":"Sur L'Océan Couleur De Fer","artist":"Wkx1f12b"},{"id":"mQBxLG6ab72","name":"Abigail","artist":"bhuTb981d"},{"id":"bqvfO0n38bbe","name":"Retreat To Hibernate","artist":"HHj7ddf1"},{"id":"mQ3mfQ61e80","name":"Faiblesse Des Sens","artist":"dmce3571a"},{"id":"mQ42925eb4e","name":"Der Liebesbrief","artist":"bh8nb69ab"},{"id":"xL4Sjo9d228","name":"My Bones to the Sea","artist":"3T7036f1a"},{"id":"xLsWHJa4cc8","name":"Somehow…","artist":"biVic16a8"},{"id":"mQ3kae81f4e","name":"To Fade With The Dusk","artist":"FUge8213"},{"id":"bCkJuWv48acf","name":"Dream House","artist":"bEVQedd3c"},{"id":"mQ6kRm7d80d","name":"Realisation","artist":"bj1lbd5a7"},{"id":"xN7HqH106c3","name":"Neoteny","artist":"cDDMQGbae56"},{"id":"mQ5N7a58c9c","name":"Der Wanderer","artist":"8OH7Ufeee58"}],"albums":[{"id":"fKE17bf54","name":"Écailles De Lune","artist":"Wkx1f12b"},{"id":"fZrp8a211","name":"Heretoir","artist":"HHj7ddf1"},{"id":"k45Pd317c","name":"Cause of Death: Life","artist":"bhuTb981d"},{"id":"fAm16dcd6","name":"To Lay Like Old Ashes","artist":"FUge8213"},{"id":"fAyd7c2e0","name":"Ruines Humaines","artist":"dmce3571a"},{"id":"cCp1QTafa1e","name":"Aokigahara","artist":"3T7036f1a"},{"id":"DLCS48c8d","name":"Les voyages de l'âme","artist":"Wkx1f12b"},{"id":"jXD99a00f","name":"Dopamine","artist":"dE8t42c41"},{"id":"0Yng30d8b","name":"Torn Beyond Reason","artist":"biVic16a8"},{"id":"jM7ge162d","name":"Amesoeurs","artist":"dmce3571a"},{"id":"bC7lOQx49c21","name":"Nucleation","artist":"cDDMQGbae56"},{"id":"4Ywh35bc2","name":"Eine Momentaufnahme - Der Rest...","artist":"bh8nb69ab"}],"artists":[{"id":"Wkx1f12b","name":"Alcest"},{"id":"bhuTb981d","name":"Happy Days"},{"id":"dmce3571a","name":"Amesoeurs"},{"id":"HHj7ddf1","name":"Heretoir"},{"id":"FUge8213","name":"Austere"},{"id":"3T7036f1a","name":"Harakiri for the sky"},{"id":"dE8t42c41","name":"Dopamine"},{"id":"b6oIfc8ff","name":"Líam"},{"id":"bEVQedd3c","name":"Deafheaven"},{"id":"cDDMQGbae56","name":"Asthenia"},{"id":"c0CP2d124","name":"Lost Inside"},{"id":"ndbZe8eb5","name":"A Light In The Dark"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3142","name":"残忍死亡金属 Brutal Death Metal","description":"残忍死亡金属又名残酷死亡金属、残暴死亡金属。欧洲的死亡金属中心无疑是瑞典的Stockholm，所以无论是残暴死亡金属还是旋律死亡金属，瑞典乐队都是非常优秀的。欧洲的残暴死亡金属代表乐队有：瑞典的Dismember、Defleshed、Hypocrisy、Gardenian；德国的Krabathor；英国的Carcass。\n通常认为残酷死亡金属的开端为Suffocation，他们的第一张EP仍带有老式死亡金属的痕迹，但第一张全长则基本上摆脱了老式死亡金属的框架，不论是演奏技法，还是编曲方式，或是复杂程度都和老式死亡金属有了明显的区别。随着残暴死亡金属的发展，一部分乐队完全脱离了老式死亡金属和其他各类金属的影响，创作的音乐更加极端和独特，被称为新派残暴死亡金属，这些音乐创作和演出的重心从对主题的阐述逐步转移到了对音乐客观极限的追求和对乐手能力技术的挑战，甚至还有专门的技术残暴死亡金属以在死亡金属的范围内尽可能的展示乐手对各乐器的高超演奏技术为宗旨。残暴死亡金属在客观音乐性上的鉴赏价值十分突出，但是由于大多数都缺乏明确并且始终如一的主题而显得缺少内涵，例如很多乐队开始不再唱歌词甚至有些不再写歌词，转而着力于演唱方式和技巧的变革，因此长期来看，很多残暴死亡金属的耐听性相对而言会比较低。","songs":[{"id":"mTk0Yi5701b","name":"Chinese band","artist":"nn9BSt5813e"},{"id":"8IsQCfeca04","name":"Omnivore","artist":"eIbF85367"},{"id":"mTaEqX7c58a","name":"My Father, My Wrath!","artist":"dqfx359fd"},{"id":"bqxt8Hu36410","name":"Apoptosis And Necrosis","artist":"nn985783523"},{"id":"xN4fwxb55dd","name":"Embryectomy - Reverse Ectrosis","artist":"9dfnzgf1cba"},{"id":"xOcDW4c824e","name":"财神到(COVER)","artist":"yhRtVha7762"},{"id":"8IpdSRfac70","name":"The Dark Coming Inside Now","artist":"JXQt1R2096d"},{"id":"mSLK1X5b167","name":"Absorption Of Corpses","artist":"yhD3969e4f8"},{"id":"8ItFzbec5d7","name":"Consumed By Repugnance","artist":"bgW11b098"},{"id":"bf3hjB02f16b","name":"Ultra Scourge","artist":"nnG5n5b4ee4"},{"id":"mSMssv549ec","name":"Parasitic Dimension Feat.

Metal","description":"电子金属是工业金属的一支，深受电子音乐影响，许多元素为EBM、Aggrotech等风格特有。电子金属的riff具有更强的旋律性，同时也更加多变，有别于工业金属的机械金属之声，电子部分则营造出空旷辽阔的太空氛围，而从EBM继承而来的交响式结构也是其显著特点之一。唱腔刺耳，种类多样，包括黑嗓、死嗓。吉他演奏近似旋死，键盘则采用了交响黑的独特演奏方式。\n\n电子金属起源于1999年左右，由The Kovenant及其他风格近似的乐队开创。虽然在90年代，这个词也用来形容Fear Factory及其相似乐队的音乐，但这些乐队的音乐更偏向工业金属。电子金属的代表乐队包括The Kovenant、Neurotech、Sybreed。\n\n(虾米编译自Rate Your Music)\n\nCyber metal is a sub-genre of Industrial Metal which incorporates numerous elements found predominantly in EBM and Aggrotech. Characteristic features of the genre include the use of more melodic and less repetitive riffs, in opposition to mostly metallic and mechanical sound of Industrial. Electronic layers sound like vast and \"cosmic\" feeling, symphonic structures incorporated from EBM genre. The vocals are harsh, ranging from singing techniques typical for aggrotech to Black Metal shrieks and Death Metal growls. Guitar melodies are played in a similar way to Melodic Death Metal, and keyboards specific to Symphonic Black Metal are frequent as well. Some bands like Deathstars, fascinated by the symbolism of totalitarianism, using it as part of the image also incorporated same aesthetic to their sound.\n\nCyber metal began around the year of 1999 with the bands like The Kovenant. In 1990s, the name cyber metal was used to describe bands like Fear Factory, however they still stay close to Industrial Metal aesthetics. Important bands of the genre are The Kovenant, Neurotech and Sybreed.","songs":[{"id":"bqvokCR37afd","name":"带电人","artist":"lif1f5d5"},{"id":"b1pPl5H41365","name":"两个世界","artist":"b664efe2f"},{"id":"xLsDgvbfc57","name":"Incipient

Metal","description":"数学金属是近两年新兴的重金属音乐风格，经常与前卫金属、前卫金属、工业金属、技术死和金属核搭配出现，最大的特点体现在其前卫性、旋律以及技术上的复杂性。通常认为这一风格始于瑞典乐队Meshuggah，在这支乐队之后衍生了众多模仿者，使其成为了一种流派。\n\n英文“Djent”一词是一个拟声词，它本意是指一个非常短促的金属音色，在演奏电吉他的时候使用中高程度的增益产生失真，并用手掌制音产生的声响效果。数学金属大范围地用到这种声响效果，并且音乐大部分也开始围绕这一点展开，以这一声响效果为突出特点，因此得名Djent。这也是它与其它众多音乐风格区分开来的一个重要特征，而且这个唯一的音乐元素贯穿整个乐队的歌曲始终。同时，吉他经常在音乐的中频的范围内非常突出，而贝司则通常也使用失真音色，着重于低频的声响效果。\n\nDjent的另一个重大特点是类似计算机数码感觉的声响效果。许多Djent风格的音乐人，比如Misha Mansoor，他们在开始出道的时候是在家里使用音箱模拟和鼓机录制自己的音乐。这种录音方式被用在正式的专辑录制中，比如Periphey的首张专辑里的鼓采样（鼓手Matt Halpern演奏一套Roland TD-20电鼓来触发采样）和来自一个Axe FX Ultra的吉他音箱模拟单元。一些Djent乐队，比如澳大利亚的Circles，会在他们的音乐中用到合成器或其它更电子化的音色，并且经常与数码程序相结合。这种朝数码电子方向发展的音乐趋势最早来自于Periphery，包括他们的吉他手Jake Bowen(他也同时也有一个做电子音乐的个人团)的吉他段落中，偶尔会使用一些合成音色和“误差”效果。\n\nDjent音乐的鼓部分往往使用了复合节拍。军鼓通常会保持基本的4/4拍律动，并以每小节第一拍为重音。在一首歌的主riff中，底鼓紧跟着吉他的律动部分，烘托出一个个强有力的节奏重音，这是Djent的一个非常基础的律动风格。这种风格的鼓的打法非常重，你可以看看Tomas Haake的演奏。Djent的鼓点有点类似Jazz的鼓点，比如它们都会使用一些“幽灵音”以及一些持续不断的稳定的拍子（通常这种持续不断的拍子会使用踩镲）。\n\n尽管Djent融合了沉重并具有复合节拍的吉他riff，复合节拍的鼓点以及一些核嗓唱腔，但它同时也包含了一些旋律段落，使用吉他的清音和合唱音色，以及传统的演唱方式营造旋律氛围。一些Djent艺术家属于专门演奏器乐曲，比如Animals As Leaders，Sky Harborh和Chimp Spanner。\n\nDjent的贝司演奏通常都是跟着吉他的音符贯穿歌曲始终，但偶尔也会背离这种传统的方式。不同的乐队在编配贝司时候的方式也是不同的，一些乐队只是用贝司来铺底，来提供额外的低频冲击力，而其它一些乐队，比如TesseracT和Monuments则让贝司的演奏更富有变化，形成特有的贝司演奏风格。\n\nDjent的一个重要的特征是使用非常低的定音方式，并且使用7弦或8弦吉他。\n\n作为Djent之父，Meshuggah掀起了一股Djent风潮，一些乐队和音乐人也开始推崇新派的Djent风格，他们是Periphery, TesseracT, Vildhjarta, Benea Reach, Chimp Spanner以及现在已经解散的Fellsilent。有一些前卫金属乐队也比较向Djent风格靠拢，而同时他们的音乐也时常会涉及到Djent。，但他们使用的和声实际上相对来说是比较有限的。这就像是一场典型的音乐风格的进化。这些乐队包括Textures, Veil of Maya, Animals As Leaders, Monuments, After the Burial, The Contortionist, Mnemic, Threat Signal, The Acacia Strain以及Meshuggah自己。\n\n(编选自: 二十一世纪的金属新名词Djent(一) by

Drone metal is sometimes associated with post-metal or experimental metal.\n\nTypically, the electric guitar is performed with a large amount of reverb or audio feedback while vocals, if present, are usually growled or screamed. Songs often lack beat or rhythm in the traditional sense and are typically very long. The experience of a drone metal performance has been described as not unlike listening to an Indian raga in the middle of an earthquake, by novelist John Wray, in The New York Times. Wray also states, \"It's hard to imagine any music being heavier or, for that matter, very much slower.\" A pioneer band of drone metal called Sunn O))) has indicated a kinship with sound sculpture. Jan Tumlir indicates a \"sustained infra-sound rumble of sub-bass–-so-called brownian noise\".\n\nDrone metal music blends elements from a variety of musical influences, including rock/metal artists such as Black Sabbath, Sleep, Swans, and minimalist composers such as Phill Niblock, Charlemagne Palestine, La Monte Young, and Tony Conrad.\n\nStephen O'Malley from Sunn O))) collaborated on an installation with artist Banks Violette, who has likened drone metal to the work of Donald Judd. Tumlir locates a precedent in Robert Rauschenberg. Violette points out, however, that drone metal is \"as much a physiological phenomenon as an acoustic one\", with an attendant physicality. O'Malley has also mentioned an appreciation for Cormac McCarthy and Richard Serra. Rhys Chatham's Essentialist included projections by Robert Longo. Jim Jarmusch's 2009 film The Limits of Control features music by a number of drone metal groups. Jarmusch said, \"I love these kind of visual landscapes they make, and they really inspired things for me for my film ..., because when I write I'm listening to things that inspire me in the direction of whatever world I'm imagining. Boris and Sunn O))) and Earth were really instrumental in me just finding a place in my head.\"","songs":[{"id":"xNYV7fa587b","name":"Sunn","artist":"9dlASl1c611"},{"id":"bCm0tf74755e","name":"Convocation","artist":"yiuu2kba50e"},{"id":"8Ic0f4f269d","name":"Seven Angels","artist":"dz7C6701f"}],"albums":[{"id":"1ttxqaac3a3","name":"NO","artist":"W80b6980"},{"id":"1twJspa0b67","name":"2R0I2P0","artist":"W80b6980"},{"id":"yhPy54108c5","name":"Temple Sleep Crystallization","artist":"yiuu2kba50e"},{"id":"1tv7Pua5729","name":"1985","artist":"W80b6980"},{"id":"nnlzH794fa9","name":"Sunn","artist":"9dlASl1c611"},{"id":"yhQ8Vo97a05","name":"Earth 2","artist":"USBgTf2c94e"}],"artists":[{"id":"W80b6980","name":"Boris"},{"id":"cCCd2ea77","name":"Sunn O)))"},{"id":"fDJFUs2b2a7","name":"The Body"},{"id":"TSXF5426897","name":"Indian"},{"id":"v4E725bbb","name":"Bong"},{"id":"cysb28826","name":"Monarch"},{"id":"9dmhzm17ac3","name":"Nadja"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3150","name":"葬礼厄运金属 Funeral Doom Metal","description":"暂无","songs":[{"id":"mSKYHd4ee55","name":"Isolation","artist":"ydeDvSccd4c"},{"id":"mSUB0Z70722","name":"The Fear After","artist":"GXB57c7e"},{"id":"xNC9QX230cd","name":"The Memory and the Thought","artist":"b8kQ16b3b"},{"id":"xNAxglaa55d","name":"The Father","artist":"nnA7dZ63ad1"},{"id":"mSLjF379da0","name":"I.

It combines elements of these genres with punk rock and pop music, adding catchy hooks and guitar riffs, while borrowing from the aesthetic of 1970s glam rock.\n\nIt arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, particularly on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene, pioneered by bands such as Kix, Hanoi Rocks, Mötley Crüe and Quiet Riot. It was popular throughout the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, bringing to prominence bands including Poison, Cinderella and Bon Jovi.\n\nThe genre rapidly lost mainstream interest from 1991 to 1994 with the rise of grunge and the release of albums such as Nirvana's Nevermind, but it has enjoyed something of a revival since the beginning of the new millennium with reunions of many popular acts from the genre`s 1980s heyday, as well as the retro styling of new bands including The Darkness and Steel Panther.","songs":[{"id":"b3bl3d3acd","name":"18 and

Metal（港台地区则译作哥德金属）是一种揉合了重金属音乐及哥特风格音乐的混合物。它的发源时间始于九十年代初的欧美。某种程度上，哥特金属是难于确认和肯定的。有些乐迷及音乐人对於曲式分类有强烈的理念，但另外的人则认为这些曲式分类是没有用的。\n\n哥特金属的出现要追溯到20世纪90年代初，英格兰北部的Paradise Lost、My Dying Bride与Anathema掀起的潮流。这三支乐队同时也催生了死亡厄运金属，哥特金属因此与死亡厄运金属有着密切的联系。三支乐队均签约于Peaceville Records唱片公司，被称为“ Peaceville三巨头”。来自哈利法克斯的Paradise Lost，1990年的首张专辑《Lost Paradise》对死亡厄运金属做了很好的定义，1991年的次张专辑《Gothic》加入了零星的键盘与女声点缀，在氛围上制造出些许差异，形成了哥特金属。Paradise Lost的前五张专辑，被形容为“一只深爱着Sisters Of Mercy的乐队演奏着黑暗时期Metallica的作品”，他们“最早播下了哥特的种子，才有了近年来其他乐队的收割”。同样来自哈利法克斯的My Dying Bride在1993年的专辑《Turn Loose the Swans》中，加入了小提琴，这一创造性的做法进一步增添了暗色浪漫，也启迪了诸多后来者。来自利物浦的Anathema，在发出了死亡厄运金属之声后，走得更远。从1995年的第二张专辑《The Silent Enigma》开始，Anathema进行了音乐上的探索，不再局限于传统死亡厄运金属领域。评论家甚至拿他们和Pink Floyd做比较。到了1996年的第三张专辑《Eternity》，Anathema甚至转向用清嗓演唱。他们这种营造悲伤大气氛围又不失哥特背景的主流摇滚姿态，对后来的主流哥特金属乐队，产生了深远影响。\n\n美国的Type O Negative、瑞典的Tiamat、荷兰的The Gathering则是哥特金属在英国以外地区的先行者。Type O Negative的音乐源于死亡金属和鞭笞金属。在1993年的专辑《Bloody Kisses》中，他们引入了一些哥特摇滚的元素，歌词中也充斥着“性、死亡、基督、吸血鬼”等内容。哥特金属从此在北美地区受到了关注。Tiamat早在1988年就开始了活动，那时他们做的是纯正的死亡金属。在1992年的专辑《Clouds》中，Tiamat降低了音乐的速度性而加强了旋律与氛围。到了1994年的《Wildhoney》，他们的转变更为明显与彻底：插入的原声吉他、呢喃耳语、天使般的合唱与失真的吉他、咆哮的死嗓形成强烈对比冲击，所营造的哥特氛围深深影响了后来的北欧乐队。The Gathering则是第一支配备了女主唱的哥特金属乐队，以Bart Smits的死嗓为主，辅以女主唱的吟唱，形成了具有黑暗根源的中板哥特厄运金属。然而早期几个女主唱均无法达到乐队期望制造的效果，直到第三张专辑《Mandylion》中Anneke van Giersbergen的出现。Anneke用她的声音将The Gathering带向了巅峰，也启迪了一大批荷兰以及欧洲其他地区女声哥特金属乐队。\n\n葡萄牙的Moonspell和英国的Cradle of Filth最早将黑金属与哥特金属进行了融合。Moonspell的早期作品以葡萄牙的乡野传说为背景，将浓郁的民族元素与极端金属结合，以Riff和键盘制造出独特忧郁氛围的恶魔之声。首张专辑《Wolfheart》出现了狼人、吸血鬼等主题的歌曲，次张专辑《Irreligious》进一步强化了哥特意味。凭着这两张专辑，Moonspell奠定了在欧洲哥特金属浪潮中的地位。Cradle of Filth则从成立之初便做着具有独特扭曲美感的哥特黑金属音乐。从1994年的首张专辑《The Principle of Evil Made Flesh》开始，由键盘演绎的前奏、不时插入的歌剧女声以及Dani Filth扭曲的嗓音和用黑与血编织的浪漫诗句就成了乐队的标志。1996年的第二张专辑《Dusk... and Her Embrace》更是一张“令人毛骨悚然的哥特史诗”，其中《Gothic Romance》一曲成为哥特黑金属的代表作。\n\n“美女与野兽”是指天籁般的女声与侵略性的死嗓对比产生的美学体验。这种技巧虽然Paradise Lost和The Gathering早已采用，但直到1995年挪威乐队Theatre of Tragedy才推出了完全“美女与野兽”式的全长专辑《Theatre of Tragedy》。随后他们又推出了《Velvet Darkness They Fear》和《Aégis》，赞誉不绝。在《Aégis》中他们进行了一些新鲜的尝试，最显著的便是Raymond Rohonyi放弃了死嗓而代之以念白与呢喃耳语，这造就了另一种对比的美学体验。90年代末，越来越多的乐队开始采用侵略性男声与天籁女声的技巧，仅挪威就又涌现出Tristania、Trail of Tears、The Sins of Thy Beloved三支乐队。Tristania除了“美女与野兽”之外，还加入了男声清嗓，进一步丰富了作品带来的听觉体验。此外，Tristania还加入了管风琴、小提琴等交响元素，引领了此后的交响哥特金属浪潮。在“美女与野兽”的推动下，涌现了一大批极具代表性的女性金属乐主唱。\n\n尝试在哥特金属中加入交响元素的不只是Tristania，来自荷兰的Within Temptation也为交响哥特的普及与推广做出了巨大贡献。成立于1996年的Within Temptation，最初做的是Sharon den Adel与Robert Westerholt构成的“美女与野兽”式哥特金属。在2000年的第二张专辑《Mother Earth》中，他们去除掉了死嗓，仅保留Sharon的天籁之音，同时加强了交响氛围，制造出极为优美动听的声音。2004年，他们凭《The Silent Force》将交响哥特金属推至一个新高度。这张专辑找来了整支交响乐团以及80人的唱诗班进行录制，充分展现了交响哥特金属的气势磅礴与华美壮丽。自此，不只是欧洲，整个世界都被这种重型吉他与交响女声的结合所征服。另一支荷兰乐队After Forever及其关联乐队Epica，不仅延续了Tritania式的交响化“美女与野兽”，还加入了前卫式的复杂编曲架构，奉献出一场场史诗般的交响盛宴。这些出色的交响哥特女声，成为了荷兰的骄傲。\n\n哥特金属的风行使得一些原本做其他风格音乐的乐队也加入了进来。瑞士的Lacrimosa，最初做的是暗潮音乐。随着女声兼键盘手 Anne Nurmi的加入，他们尝试在原有风格的基础上引入了重型吉他以及古典乐器，形成了独有的兼具暗潮感和古典氛围的交响哥特金属。交响金属名团Therion，也在2007年推出了名为《Gothic Kabbalah》的专辑，展露出他们想和哥特金属接轨的想法。","songs":[{"id":"ePV6D3b5e6","name":"She Is My

Grindcore","description":"碾核即Grindcore，是一种音乐风格。碾核这个名词经常与有些联系的死亡金属交换使用，这两个其实是有很大差别的，虽然有相似的特征，同样结构的音乐，特别是21世纪以来来越来越相像。当它在80年代中期第一次露面的时候，碾核因它完美用短的篇章所组成的机构带起了重金属乐器风格上噪音演奏的一阵潮流（扭曲的吉他，贝斯和鼓声）。\n\n虽然碾核不是随便的临时准备，它的确也没有沿袭传统的音乐结构；即使有时重复段被精选出来，完美的碾核从不以诗篇，合唱甚至是悦耳的音调为特征。碾核的声乐特点听起来是痛苦的，归类于高倾斜的尖叫到低声，从喉咙发出的低沉的咆哮；尽管歌词经常是冗长的，很难被理解的。碾核带来的思想意识上的侵略就是如此，超越了指向其发起于鞭挞金属和硬核朋克根源的顶端，很难让人完全描绘出它事实上听起来的效果。无可争议的，碾核音乐形式的发起者是Napalm Death，他们在1987年发行了第一张专辑Scum，这也是一张最具碾核风格代表性的专辑。在Napalm Death这个乐队里，碾核更具有艺术性，在音乐中隐含着阴冷，暴虐和现代社会的腐朽；加之他们的歌词被愤怒的社会群体所包裹着。在歌词写作上更极端的乐队便是Carcass，这是唯一一个真正成为原始碾核音色缩影的乐队；他们可怕，血淋淋的咆哮形式是逐字的从解剖课本上参考而来的，为了最大的震动效果。然而碾核最初的形式是有固定限制的，它的强度可以很容易就转为self-parody；在Napalm Deaths的第二张专辑中，他们已经开始尝试工业的质地，一种融化，它可以证实流行不仅仅是依靠热爱用鼓奏出jackhammer节奏的乐队，而是同样可以用像Godflesh那样缓慢，忧郁的韵律（它本身就是一个Napalm Death的支流）。碾核酷热的强度不仅被地下重金属吸收了，还被avant-garde和试验音乐这两个派系借鉴：如日本的噪音乐队the Boredoms和Merzbow发现了它的灵感，爵士乐手John Zorn形成了碾核思想的乐队Painkiller（它是以早期Napalm Death的鼓手为号召物的）。尽管完美的碾核是完全的英国现象，但早期佛罗里达乐队Death的专辑带有自然的，粗糙的和好供给的性质，从而使它们非常相像。除了吸取大部分碾核自然，恶魔般咆哮的嗓音特点，美国那些在有限的技术能力上相关联的死亡金属乐队，演奏出类似碾核般很快的节奏的歌曲效果。事实上，在90年代，Napalm Death的声音已很难分出是死亡金属或是碾核，并且Carcass已经成为一个成熟的死亡乐队。A.C.是少数几个仍坚持演奏原始碾核风格的乐队之一了。\n\n碾核是一种极端的音乐态度！虽然不是metal，但是它的表现手法要比metal极端的多。极端意识是碾核的精髓。碾核的派系也有多种，Old School Grindcore 、Goregrind、Gore Metal 、德式Porngrind 、美式Porngrind 、Cybergrind、Grind Roll 、Noisegrind 、Toilet/Shit Noisegrind ，这些碾核的形式就不在这里多多赘述了，有兴趣的朋友可以到百度或者google搜集一些相关资料。当然，碾核的形式除了以上几种之外还有很多种，碾核的宗旨：摆脱一切音乐理念束缚！随心所至，用最极端的音乐彻底毁灭一切！\n\n代表性乐队：Napalm Death，Brutal Truth，Terrorizer，Anal Cunt，Fuck...I'm Dead，Last Days Of Humanity，Disgorge（Mex），Cock And Ball Torture，Gut，Intestinal Disgorge，Abosranie Bogom等。\n\n碾核音乐的流派与发展\n\nGrind 意思就是碾碎，而加上Core就变成了极端的地下音乐类型。Grindcore可译为“碾核”，因为极为粗糙、扭曲恶劣的音乐派系而成为地下音乐中的地下。早期主题大多是强烈批判社会，步入21世纪则转为单纯不平衡的泄愤，特色是变态血腥、情色封面及短促激烈的曲风。碾核可以分成以下几种，当然还有些碾核流派在不断涌出，在不久的将来碾核会以更多极端的形式来碾碎你们的耳膜！\n\n1）老式碾核风格\n老式碾核风格，师承早期Napalm Death、Brutal Truth及Terrorizer，主唱一般为标准的一高一低双主唱，吉他演奏为典型的粘质的核味十足的riff，而比起Napalm Death等老前辈来，21世纪这些乐队的音乐更快、更重也更加背经离道。代表乐队有美国的Pig Destroyer、Phobia、Benumb；瑞典的Birdflesh、Nasum（后期）；法国的Blockheads、日本的324等等。不过这一类型的碾核乐队似乎在整体上已不占主流。\n\n2）血腥碾核\n这类风格的乐队占据了大多数，风格主要受Carcass及Impetigo等乐队的影响，歌曲的主题嗜血如癖，对疾病、尸体赤裸裸的阐述到了极尽详细而无可附加的地步。主唱以深喉兽吼及经加工处理的“水喉”效果唱腔为主；吉他演奏以Grindcore类的噪音riff为主，并伴有Death Metal式的工整而充斥邪恶感的riff；鼓则是blast beat从头至尾高速暴猛无比。代表乐队有较早期的波兰的Dead Infection、捷克的Pathologist、瑞典的Regurgitate、西班牙的Haemorrhage，21世纪后有墨西哥的Disgorge、荷兰的Last Days of Humanity、德国的Sanitys Dawn、巴西的Neuro-Visceral Exhumation等等。\n\n3）Gore Metal\n严格地说，这一风格应该是核与死亡金属之间的过渡类型。虽然在主题上、歌词上与Goregrind一样，对“血腥”充满了无限的渴求，但比起Goregrind乐队，这类风格的乐队更接近中期Carcass（他们的3rd）。大量Death Metal，甚至是Thrash Metal中常见的音乐元素被采用，比如吉他演奏就非常工整，与核类乐队有着明显的不同；再比如鼓的节奏变换频繁，重型而缓慢的敲击方式与金属乐颇为相象。按理说，这类乐队与其说是碾核乐队，更应该归Death Metal一类的乐队中去，但奇怪的是这类乐队都以碾核乐队自居并不与纯粹的Death Metal乐队为伍。鉴于这是一种Death/Grind的过渡型乐队，所以这里也归在Grindcore中。代表乐队有Exhumed、Impaled、Lord Gore、The Country Medical Examiners等。\n\n4）色情碾核\n这类乐队公认的“鼻祖”应该是德国的Gut。这种风格的乐队大都大量使用色情引子；通过歌本、歌词极尽淫荡之能事；音乐上晦涩怪异；曲速以中速甚至是慢速为主，以快速为辅；主唱大都是加入效果器处理的超级“水”嗓唱腔。由于此类乐队大多集中在德国乐队中，所以也称为德式色碾。代表乐队有德国的Cock and Ball Torture、Meatknife、Mucupurulent（早期）、Cunt Grinder；法国的Gronibard、Purulent Excretor、芬兰的Creamface等等。\n\n5）美式Porn Grind\n美式色碾从音乐形式上与Old School Grindcore较为接近，主要是通过主题内容及歌词上区分开，而较新的乐队则有与US Style Brutal Death融合的趋势。代表乐队早期的有Anal Cunt、Meat Shits；21世纪有Anal Blast等。\n\n6）电子碾核\n这是德式Porn Grind的一个分支。主要特征是很少或者根本没有吉他、贝司、鼓等乐器，而是使用电子乐器创造出Grindcore一样的音乐效果，用冷冰冰的电子和声来表达“Porno”这一主题。代表乐队有德国的Libido Airbag；荷兰的S.M.E.S.；美国的Microphallus等。\n\n7）摇滚碾核\n这是一种比起德式Porn Grind更加缓慢的碾核音乐，也可以说是整个碾核音乐领域中最慢的。有的时候甚至会有大量的硬摇滚一样的节奏，但这种音乐也是最富变化、最不可揣摩的诡怪的音乐，经常有出人意料的小节。代表乐队有德国的Dead；澳洲的Blood Duster；日本的C.S.S.O.等。\n\n8）噪音碾核\n这些乐队追求终极的噪音效果，是目前地球上最疯狂的音乐。音乐放荡不羁，毫无悦耳可言。录音混乱而粗糙；吉他与敲打乐器（大多使用鼓机）均以制造噪音为己任；而主唱更是发出各式外星人般的声响。主要代表乐队有美国的Intestinal Disgorge、Asscavern；法国的Blue Holocaust；日本的Gore Beyond Necropsy等等。\n\n9）厕碾\n严格地讲，这是噪音碾核的一个分支。从歌词到主唱再到音乐气氛无不让人联想到Toilet/Shit一类的东西。代表乐队有美国的moebic Dysentery、Rectal Explosion；以色列的Abosranie Bogom；巴西的C.V.I.；德国的Anal Whore，日本的Basket of Death等等。\n\n10）鼓机Grind\n其实这并不应该单独算作一种风格，之所以把它单拿出来，是因为这些乐队很难归于以上的某种风格中。这类乐队使用鼓机代替真鼓，鼓机编排在乐队中所占分量很重，基本上是能多快就编多快，达到了敲击乐器的极限光速的地步。而主题大多涉及色情与暴力，主唱则以水喉唱腔为主（有时也使用低吼及尖叫演唱）。代表乐队有澳洲的Decomposing Serenity、Fuck...I'm Dead；巴西的Lymphatic Phelgm；美国的Agoraphobic Nosebleed、Prosthetic Cunt；荷兰的Brutality Reigns Supreme等等。\n\n11）搞笑碾\n因为有搞笑的成分所以称之为搞笑碾核， 它更体现了碾核的随意性。代表乐队有德国乐队Excrementory，Grindfuckers；加拿大的Shy Shit；法国的Gronibard，Ultra Vomit，中国第一欢乐搞笑碾核：Cave Have Rod穴有棍乐队。德国乐队的可听性比较强。搞笑度都要大于其他的乐队。中国的乐队搞笑实力也不容小觑，穴有棍乐队（Cave Have Rod）成立于2011年7月底，他们用快乐的态度，创作属于他们自己的碾核音乐。\n\n12）高速碾核\n所谓高速碾核大概就是因为音乐中鼓的速度像高频的砸锤机，就是一个字 快 ！代表乐队有瑞典的Nasum。\n\n13）其他\n碾核的类型真可谓多种多样，比如：带有很强Black Metal味道的巴西的Flesh Grinder；使用了Funky及Jazz音乐元素的南非的Groinchurn；有很强Horror Metal味道的西班牙的Gruesome Stuff Relish；工噪感十足的德国的Nunwhore Commando 666等等等等。鉴于碾核是一种自由自在、随心所欲的音乐，所以很难说清它到底有多少类型。\n\n综上所述，碾核音乐由于其无拘无束的气质及不断扩展的外延，不但在这些年中不但没有减少消失，反而越发年轻而显得富有朝气。在不久的将来世界各地的Grinders必将带给我们更多、更好的作品。\n\n(百度百科)","songs":[{"id":"mQ9V5X681c9","name":"Collateral

（Melodic Death Metal） 的兴起。有关死亡旋律金属的起源，有的人认为 Sentenced 发表的大碟 North From Here 是第一张旋律死亡金属唱片。但是，大多数人认为旋律死亡金属真正的发源地是哥德堡。\n\n极端的时代带来极端的力量，旋律死亡金属是死亡金属这一风格中一股新兴的巨大力量，这种音乐含有大量的吉他旋律solo演奏，多数具有双吉他的组合型态，有的以键盘来突显音乐的旋律节奏感和编曲的丰富性。旋律死亡金属除了传统死亡金属的极端粗暴和强烈的节奏元素外，也很重视编曲的旋律性。简单的歌词，连贯的歌唱和传统死亡的咆哮声，有时用清晰的唱法取代传统低沉咆哮声线。旋律死亡金属多半来自北欧斯堪的那维亚半岛一带，特别是瑞典和芬兰。\n\n四天王Dark Tranquillity的“The Gallery”、In Flames的“The Jester Race”、At The Gates的“Slaughter of the Soul”， Dissection

metal）是重金属音乐的一种分支，在音乐风格、演奏及编曲上受到西洋古典音乐的极大影响。音乐中常有高技术性的演奏，或是加入知名古典音乐的桥段或元素。英格威·玛姆斯汀（Yngwie Johann Malmsteen）在1980年代为新古典金属的发展做出极大的贡献。\n\n新古典金属不同于音乐上的新古典主义。新古典主义代表着音乐上的现代主义，作曲者受到古典主义音乐的影响，流行时期是在两次世界大战之间。这类型的音乐可视为对19世纪浪漫主义音乐（特别是理查德·瓦格纳的音乐）的反动。作曲者如伊戈尔·斯特拉文斯基与保罗·亨德密特，将古典音乐元素与他们独特的和声语汇与节奏变化融合在一起。\n\n另一方面，新古典金属音乐并未限制自己回到古典艺术的规范，如要求音乐的平衡或形式。事实上，比起古典主义音乐，新古典金属受到巴洛克音乐及浪漫主义音乐更大的影响。因此，新古典金属与新古典主义音乐并不相同。新古典金属将“古典”这个字视为一般民众所认知的西方古典音乐－从巴洛克、浪漫主义到早期现代主义的作品－而不是古典主义音乐的复兴。因此，有些人认为“新古典”的名称是不适当的，而且会使人误解。\n\n在1980年代时，就已有最纯粹的新古典金属。但在之前，新古典金属就已存在于许多重金属音乐家的音乐风格之中。早期受到古典乐影响的硬摇滚和重金属音乐的知名音乐人有Ritchie Blackmore、 Uli Jon Roth、Randy Rhoads和布赖恩·梅。这种演奏风格以吉他手为主，但也有其他乐器的乐手，如键盘手 Rick Wakeman。从摇滚乐出现以来，电吉他的演奏技巧就快速发展，而在1970年代以前，新古典金属所需要的演奏技巧并不存在。到了80年代，摇滚乐的吉他技巧发展到最高峰。新古典金属为人所熟知的，是源自于西洋古典乐的高超技巧与理论面。新古典金属的普及化及成长，与吉他速弹运动风气的上升有密切的关系，许多新古典金属吉他手的演奏灵感来自于古典音乐家，像是尼科罗·帕格尼尼和弗雷德里克·肖邦。\n\n瑞典吉他手英格威·玛姆斯汀被多数人认为是最原始的新古典金属形式的创立者。他在青少年时期受到了摇滚和古典乐两种音乐风格的影响。1982年，Shrapnel Records 的 Mike Varney 将英格威的音乐引进美国。\n\n新古典金属的黄金时代是在1980年代晚期，当时许多吉他手与 Shrapnel Records 签约成为旗下艺人，包括英格威·玛姆斯汀、东尼·麦考潘 、菲尼·摩尔、保罗·吉尔伯特、Greg Howe、Joey Tafolla、David Chastain、杰森·贝克和马帝·菲曼。这些音乐家大部分都走向英格威·玛姆斯汀在80年代早期至中期的演奏形式。\n\n今日，许多乐团选择作为一个整体，而抛弃过去的独奏音乐家形式。一些知名的新古典金属音乐家或乐团有 Michael Angelo Batio、乔·史丹、大卫·凡迪斯、Symphony X、Stratovarius、Adagio、Apocalyptica和死神悍将（Warmen）。有些主流金属乐团也稍微受到了新古典金属的影响，像是死神之子、Between the Buried and Me、The Human Abstract 和 Protest the Hero。\n\n新古典金属经常改编古典音乐作品，并以乐团的形式演奏。特别是巴洛克音乐和古典主义音乐，其独特的音乐及技巧能有效地融入摇滚之中。常用的古典乐技巧有对位和持续音等等。","songs":[{"id":"b1japa9d64","name":"Goodbye to

of the Seven Keys,Part1）(1987年)和《七把钥匙的主人第二乐章》（Keeper of the

Punk Metal","description":"朋克金属是硬核朋克和鞭鞑金属的混合体，它在80年代中期的时候开始变得突出。这两者会结合到一起是很自然的，因为这两种风格都是强硬而偏好连复段的，并都常具有狂躁的速度。朋克金属乐队通常比普通的硬核朋克有着更好的技术，而他们的连复段又不像鞭鞑金属他们的那样复杂，歌曲结构通常也更简单明了。在早期的时候，朋克金属与滑板朋克有着极其密切的联系，但是随着时间的推移，它越来越成为金属乐迷的领地。进入90年代以后，那些依然留存的朋克金术逐渐转向了后来人们所称作的“另类金属”领域：比如，Corrosion of Conformity 就演奏一种朴素的甚至破旧的音乐，有点像经典的 Black Sabbath 的声音；而 Suicidal Tendencies 则实验将另类摇滚与放克金属结合到了一起。\n\nHard rock is a term that's frequently applied to any sort of loud, aggressive guitar rock, but for these purposes, the definition is more specific. To be sure, hard rock is loud, aggressive guitar rock, but it isn't as heavy as heavy metal, and it's only very rarely influenced by punk (though it helped inspire punk). Hard rock generally prizes big, stadium-ready guitar riffs, anthemic choruses, and stomping, swaggering backbeats; its goals are usually (though not universally) commercial, and it's nearly always saturated with machismo. With some bands, it can be difficult to tell where the dividing line between hard rock and heavy metal falls, but the basic distinction is that ever since Black Sabbath, metal tends to be darker and more menacing, while hard rock (for the most part) has remained exuberant, chest-thumping party music. Additionally, while metal riffs often function as stand-alone melodies, hard rock riffs tend to outline chord progressions in their hooks, making for looser, more elastic jams should the band decide to stretch out instrumentally. Like heavy metal, hard rock sprang from the mid-'60s intersection of blues-rock and psychedelia pioneered by artists like Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and the Jeff Beck Group. Blues-rock and psychedelia were both exploring the limits of electric amplification, and blues-rock was pushing the repeated guitar riff center stage, while taking some of the swing out of the blues beat and replacing it with a thumping power. Hard rock really came into its own at the dawn of the '70s, with the tough, boozy rock of the Rolling Stones (post-Brian Jones) and Faces, the blues-drenched power and textured arrangements of Led Zeppelin, the post-psychedelic rave-ups of Deep Purple, and the loud, ringing power chords of the Who (circa Who's Next) setting the template for much of what followed. Later in the decade, the lean, stripped-down riffs of AC/DC and Aerosmith, the catchy tunes and stage theatrics of Alice Cooper and Kiss, and the instrumental flash of Van Halen set new trends, though the essential musical blueprint for hard rock remained similar. Arena rock also became a dominant force, stripping out nearly all blues influence and concentrating solely on big, bombastic hooks. During the '80s, hard rock was dominated by glossy pop-metal, although Guns N' Roses, the Black Crowes, and several others did present a grittier, more traditionalist alternative. Old-fashioned hard rock became a scarce commodity in the post-alternative rock era; after grunge, many guitar bands not only adopted a self-consciously serious attitude, but also resisted the urge to write fist-pumping, arena-ready choruses. Still, the '90s did produce a few exceptions, such as Oasis, Urge Overkill, and the serious but anthemic Pearl Jam.","songs":[{"id":"TM9r81374","name":"Voice Of The

Green）等。\n\n(Laluna1982@百度)","songs":[{"id":"b5BCec0752","name":"Walk","artist":"2IQ883d8"},{"id":"mQYdJI6d8db","name":"盲山(單曲版)","artist":"nmS0Lw70622"},{"id":"8Glt711b2ed","name":"Excavation (Part

Metal","description":"速度金属流派是80年代早期美国地下音乐中最受欢迎的重金属形式之一。速度为其标榜的主要特色。经常会和“鞭击金属”产生混淆，通常“速度金属”的音乐较具旋律性，主唱歌词咬字较清楚，吉他间奏富旋律性且快速而流畅；而“鞭击金属”则较缺乏旋律性，完全与速度、重量、压迫感和破坏力并重。通常“鞭击金属”乐队和“速度金属”乐队的乐手们都拥有纯熟高超的乐器演奏技巧。\n\n作为英国重金属新浪潮与硬核朋克的交叉，速度金属极其地迅速、极具研磨性、而且对技术有着很高的要求，因为乐队一方面要演奏得很快，一方面又要使弹奏准确而干净。从这个意义上讲，速度金属一直都保持了它金属根源的真实性。但是它从硬核那里借鉴来的元素——疯狂而快速的节奏，和反叛的自己动手的精神——却是同样重要的，因为它们不仅使乐队拥有了一种独特的音乐手法，还使他们在圈子外的大批年轻人中树立了一种极富魅力的形象。因为它是如此激烈，对技术的要求又颇高，速度金属很快就转化为了鞭鞑金属，因为后者在节拍、音乐套路、乐器技巧上有更大的发展空间。在 Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax和 Slayer 引领下的金属乐队的新浪潮与那些在80年代统治了排行榜的流行导向的金属乐队是站在直接对立的立场上的，但他们仍得以没有主流媒体、广播、音乐电视的支持的情况下，成功的培养了一批狂热而忠实的追随者，并最终使他们的唱片达到了白金销量。\n\nSpeed Metal自1980年代中末期兴起之后，至今依然是欧洲重金属乐的主流乐风，其快速流畅且音色优美的吉他solo，加上高音主唱、速踩双大鼓和优美的旋律线，这样兼具了爆发力与美感的组合，自然成为多数乐迷的最爱。\n\n促成Speed Metal乐派开始扬威于全欧洲的经典之作，首推Helloween的《Keeper of The Seven Keys》双专辑，时至今日，依然有大量的新生代speed乐团延续早期的Helloween风格，这类型的风格被称为传统(正统)式Speed Metal。当然Speed Metal亦有不同型式的衍生，如Melodic Metal，虽通常指的就是Speed Metal，不过一些没有Speed Metal那么「速」而又十分强调旋律优美感的乐团，在分类上便会将其标上「melodic」，以突显其音乐风格有较流畅的旋律感。\n\n代表性乐队\nHelloween，Blind Guardian，Gamma Ray，Riot，Rage，Anthrax，Kreator，Megadeth，Metal Church，Metallica，Motorhead，Overkill，Paradise

Metal是近年来声势快速高涨的分支乐派，此新兴乐派又是以意大利乐团为首，Symphonic指的是交响式的编曲，通常是运用大量keyboard合成器的弦乐效果来营造出交响乐式的盛大华丽气氛，当然也有乐团会采用真实的弦乐器。金属乐与交响乐的结合，在欧洲古典音乐发展的历史背景下，自是一种自然的趋势。\n\n老外给交响金属下了这样一个定义：交响金属包括含有交响元素的金属音乐；这种元素听起来接近古典交响音乐。交响金属是金属音乐中的一种流派，同时也可以融合在金属音乐的各个流派之中，比如交响黑金属，就交响力量金属等。\n\n这个定义有一定的意义，但是也很模糊。比如“听起来像交响音乐”，这就因人而异了，因为每个人对事物都有自己的区分方法。我想，如果让一个交响音乐爱好者来听现在的交响金属，那么“交响”这两个字恐怕对大多数“交响金属”是多余的。反过来说，如果让一个非音乐爱好者去听一支善于应用键盘的乐队，那么很有可能这支乐队的作品就会被认为是“交响金属”。\n\nSymphonic metal is a term used to describe heavy metal music that has symphonic elements; that is, elements that are borrowed from other music genres (i.e classical music, progressive rock) but usually with more keyboards or acoustic guitars and typically an operatic female lead vocalist.\n\nWhen referring to bands from other genres, it refers to bands who use minor classical and operatic themes in their music similar to what one finds in the symphonic metal genre, to show they are more \"symphonic\" than other bands within their genre. Although many symphonic metal bands base their style solidly on classical music, few follow a theatrical, more epic approach to this genre by including or basing their style in Film Music or movie soundtracks. A popular example of this type of approach would be the works of the successful Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish.","songs":[{"id":"ePV6D3b5e6","name":"She Is My Sin","artist":"butLff8ad"},{"id":"b3dbAb6938","name":"Forever","artist":"buqzefcb9"},{"id":"ckQ5Zea28c","name":"Memories","artist":"d21c3fcda"},{"id":"U3kJ58ba3","name":"Lost in Life","artist":"bePMa4676"},{"id":"cidBUe286e","name":"Ich verlasse heut' Dein Herz","artist":"UsO9c42d"},{"id":"f84gR3f892","name":"Chapter I","artist":"6mN8705f"},{"id":"cQCgY20621","name":"Hope","artist":"6jZ17727"},{"id":"Ulynb6091","name":"Cry for the Moon (The Embrace That Smothers, Pt. 4)","artist":"beAbafc6f"},{"id":"b4n5Maa504","name":"Lemuria","artist":"UnDd05a0"},{"id":"erWwY32fe7","name":"Hijo de la Luna","artist":"b48C19c5a"},{"id":"mQ3CQv73bd5","name":"Emerald Sword","artist":"Wrt1617b"},{"id":"U8Ya7f685","name":"The River Flows Frozen","artist":"EVxc187e"}],"albums":[{"id":"eNZm6091f","name":"Wishmaster","artist":"butLff8ad"},{"id":"1irb31c00","name":"Imaginaerum","artist":"butLff8ad"},{"id":"3Yni37ad2","name":"Episode","artist":"buqzefcb9"},{"id":"eNZl87a20","name":"Oceanborn","artist":"butLff8ad"},{"id":"C4sI47432","name":"The Silent Force","artist":"d21c3fcda"},{"id":"jaita388c","name":"Once","artist":"butLff8ad"},{"id":"f8wn61730","name":"Made in Hong Kong (And in Vari...","artist":"butLff8ad"},{"id":"eUyBa037f","name":"A Sombre Dance","artist":"6mN8705f"},{"id":"eNYk84a48","name":"Elodia","artist":"UsO9c42d"},{"id":"fJXb94331","name":"Bestwishes","artist":"butLff8ad"},{"id":"04f0523d3","name":"The 13th Floor","artist":"bePMa4676"},{"id":"owAee5e90","name":"The Unforgiving","artist":"d21c3fcda"}],"artists":[{"id":"butLff8ad","name":"Nightwish"},{"id":"d21c3fcda","name":"Within Temptation"},{"id":"hcy99b3f","name":"X JAPAN"},{"id":"b4v0f21d2","name":"Sound Horizon"},{"id":"UsO9c42d","name":"Lacrimosa"},{"id":"buqzefcb9","name":"Stratovarius"},{"id":"bePMa4676","name":"Sirenia"},{"id":"6oN6855b","name":"Xandria"},{"id":"beAbafc6f","name":"Epica"},{"id":"b48C19c5a","name":"Haggard"},{"id":"UnDd05a0","name":"Therion"},{"id":"6jZ17727","name":"Apocalyptica"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3147","name":"技术死亡金属 Technical Death Metal","description":"技术死亡金属是死亡金属的一种，注重创作及编排技巧。这种风格起源于90年代早期至中期，由Death、Atheist、Nocturnus、Pestilence等乐队开创，代表性乐队包括Necrophagist、Nile、Decapitated、Cryptopsy、Origin、Spawn of Possession、Obscura、The Faceless。\n\n(虾米编译自Rate Your Music)\n\nTechnical death metal is a sub-genre of Death Metal with particular focus on challenging, demanding songwriting and instrumental skill that began and developed in the early- to mid-1990s with bands like Death, Atheist, Nocturnus and Pestilence, to name a few.\n\nSome of the distinct features of this genre include dynamic song structures, complex and atypical rhythmic structures, abundant use of diminished chords and arpeggios, frequent employment of odd time chord progressions and a lot of string skipping on the guitars. The music is normally extremely fast-paced and the representative bands remain firmly rooted in death metal due to their unbending devotion to rhythmic heaviness and conceptual darkness. However, when compared to death metal and its other sub-genres, aside from the features mentioned above, technical death metal bands usually give a different feeling to the music by frequently using more exotic scales. The bass lines are usually complex and the drums are extremely fast-paced with abundant use of blast-beats and other extreme drumming techniques.\n\nSome of the most known representative bands

MORTUM（NOKTURNAL MORTUM真的很棒，可惜不是在北欧，漂亮的乌克兰小调加上残暴的黑金属。撤远了……）。再看看维京金属乐团的装束，在形象上他们喜欢把自己刻画成为维京勇士，这就是最显著的标志。最后，瞧瞧歌迷在现场的装束，头带双角海盗头盔，腰带牛角大酒杯，高声合唱，开怀畅饮……\n\n(百度百科)","songs":[{"id":"esi9E2ecd2","name":"Lai Lai

stooges, the new york dolls----直到70年代中期朋克音乐流派才正式形成。西方的许多新生乐队不再强调区别于主流硬核摇滚的超音乐形式，而是直指音乐的本质。纽约的第一只朋克乐队是the ramones; 在伦敦则以sex pistols为代表。尽管他们的音乐表现不尽相同----the ramones显得轻快随意，相比之下the pistols更强调了重复段落表达-----可是这些独特的尝试革命性地影响了美式音乐和英式音乐的风格。朋克音乐在美国一直低调地存在，最终在80年代孕育了硬核摇滚和独立摇滚概念。而在英国，朋克摇滚则成为大众的宠儿。sex pistols被看作是对政府和君主制的严重颠覆。更重要的是，有越来越多的乐队加入了朋克摇滚。一些乐队几乎照搬了pistols的原始风格，另一些则创出了属于自己的新的元素，如buzzcocks的尖锐摇滚，clash的赞美诗般的瑞格摇滚，以及wire 和 joy division的艺术试验。不久，朋克分裂为后朋克（比原先更具艺术性和试验性），新浪潮（更具东方流行意味），和硬核摇滚（一种形式上更激烈更快速更具侵略性的朋克音乐）。整个八十年代，英国和美国都将朋克的定义与硬和摇伦联系在一起。90年代初，一批朋克复兴主义者----以green

Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produced recordings and distributed them through informal channels.\nThe term \"punk\" was first used in relation to rock music by some American critics in the early 1970s, to describe garage bands and their devotees. By late 1976, bands such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash and The Damned in London and Television and the Ramones in New York City were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement. The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world, and it became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream.

Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produced recordings and distributed them through informal channels.\nThe term \"punk\" was first used in relation to rock music by some American critics in the early 1970s, to describe garage bands and their devotees. By late 1976, bands such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash and The Damned in London and Television and the Ramones in New York City were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement. The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world, and it became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. An associated punk subculture emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive styles of clothing and adornment and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, faster, more aggressive styles such as hardcore and Oi! had become the predominant mode of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued a broad range of other variations, giving rise to post-punk and the alternative rock movement. At the start of the 21st century, pop punk had been adopted by the mainstream, as bands such as Green Day, The Offspring and Blink-182 brought the genre widespread popularity.","songs":[{"id":"8FZAr918888","name":"Every Breath You Take","artist":"2Jka782c"},{"id":"mQ6vKy53ba0","name":"Open Up Your Heart And Let The Sun Shine In","artist":"6lO6a441"},{"id":"cqy0Wf3a2a","name":"小さな恋のうた","artist":"EPf59024"},{"id":"b1pSUPM3cc90","name":"永远的乌托邦","artist":"i9oe91a5"},{"id":"ckD3m1a57b","name":"Over My Head (Better Off Dead)","artist":"6ix8e41d"},{"id":"jYjS15a04","name":"觉醒","artist":"dsX54c66"},{"id":"gjSQj4b18e","name":"London Calling","artist":"2DS5f307"},{"id":"f5cRA40d21","name":"God Save the Queen","artist":"SMvd20b0"},{"id":"b0qoDc1bc3","name":"Basket Case","artist":"SGQd9a08"},{"id":"chP6Ye28c2","name":"Post Blue","artist":"bt4i17f2c"},{"id":"fatG91380","name":"我不想失去你","artist":"gbhddfe5"}],"albums":[{"id":"8Z3v3d263","name":"Every Breath You Take: The Cla...","artist":"2Jka782c"},{"id":"04gV30681","name":"Message","artist":"EPf59024"},{"id":"eUhU963f7","name":"Does This Look Infected?","artist":"6ix8e41d"},{"id":"jhje995ab","name":"The Libertines","artist":"6t07142f"},{"id":"wX1O2759b","name":"永远的乌托邦","artist":"i9oe91a5"},{"id":"3Mf5c153","name":"觉醒","artist":"dsX54c66"},{"id":"nnc1CY59dfa","name":"時代在召喚","artist":"nmS0Lw70622"},{"id":"xSLg9Ib0908","name":"谈钞票伤感情 谈感情又伤钞票又伤感情","artist":"tm4c403"},{"id":"dQny49618","name":"新裤子 同名专辑","artist":"gbhddfe5"},{"id":"sTjo2478f","name":"Sun Fun Gun","artist":"ueW3af83"},{"id":"ERf74d7a","name":"Never Mind the Bollocks Here's...","artist":"SMvd20b0"},{"id":"bdwBb7f0d","name":"London Calling","artist":"2DS5f307"}],"artists":[{"id":"SGQd9a08","name":"Green Day"},{"id":"hd5c8555","name":"椎名林檎"},{"id":"6ix8e41d","name":"Sum 41"},{"id":"SKf9ebec","name":"Iggy Pop"},{"id":"SMvd20b0","name":"Sex Pistols"},{"id":"2Jka782c","name":"The Police"},{"id":"i9oe91a5","name":"脑浊乐队"},{"id":"2DS5f307","name":"The Clash"},{"id":"SK4bf881","name":"Ramones"},{"id":"fWia8851","name":"Joyside"},{"id":"iABe6049","name":"舌头乐队"},{"id":"nmS0Lw70622","name":"假假條"}]},{"type":"style","id":"964","name":"流行朋克 Pop Punk","description":"流行朋克(Pop Punk)是朋克摇滚(Punk Rock)和流行音乐的一种融合，将朋克急速的节奏、变化的和弦，和流行化的旋律和歌词相结合。\n\nPop Punk这个词最早是在何时被使用的已无从考证，但最早雏形可以追溯到上世纪70年代中后期，六七十年代的原型朋克(Proto-Punk)和电力流行(Power Pop)乐队为Pop Punk的出现铺下了基石。早期代表乐队有美国的Ramones和英国的Buzzcocks、The Undertones。\n\n到了80年代中期，一些乐队尝试把硬核朋克(Hardcore Punk)和流行音乐结合，开创了Pop Punk的一种新声音。\n80年代中后期，来自“加利福尼亚地下朋克圈”的Green Day、The Offspring等乐队开始在本土范围内流行。1994年，Green Day的第三张专辑《Dookie》的空前成功真正带动了90年代的“Pop Punk热潮”，使其登上了主流音乐的舞台。第二波“Pop Punk热潮”在上世纪末爆发，同样来自美国加州的Blink-182凭借99年的专辑《Enema of the State》，勇登Billboard排行榜的前十名，专辑的全球销量突破了一千五百万张，开创了Pop Punk在主流市场的巅峰地位。\n\n由地下逐渐走向主流的流行朋克，其歌词演绎内容由讽刺批判社会，转变成关于爱情、生活、流行文化等，传统朋克的“愤世嫉俗”也正在被“健康向上”的商业流行因素所取代。流行朋克也越来越受到欧美流行音乐界的追捧，因为它代表着年轻人的时髦潮流和对生活的态度。\n\n2005年开始，情绪硬核(Emo)的融入让Pop punk继续流行了几年，直至2009年开始日渐式微。\n\n带动流行朋克发展的艺人主要有Green Day、Blink-182、Simple Plan、Good Charlotte、Sum 41、Avril Lavigne、My Chemical Romance、Fall Out Boy、Paramore等。\n\nPop punk (also known as pop-punk, punk-pop or easycore) is a fusion music genre that combines elements of punk rock with pop music to varying degrees. Pop-influenced punk rock first emerged in the mid-1970s in multiple countries, and was stylistically similar to power pop. The Ramones are generally considered among the earliest bands to merge pop melodies with punk rock, and were followed by bands such as the Buzzcocks and Bad Religion. The music typically combines fast punk tempos, chord changes and loud guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes.\n\nBy the early 1980s, several groups—most notably the Descendents, Screeching Weasel and The Vandals—merged hardcore punk with pop to create a new, faster pop punk sound. Regionally, pop punk thrived in California where independent labels adopted a do it yourself (DIY) approach to releasing their music. In the mid 1990s, Green Day and The Offspring rapidly brought mainstream acceptance to the genre, selling millions of records and receiving extensive radio and television airplay. Ska punk, which shared many characteristics with pop punk, also gained popularity with notable bands Sublime and No Doubt.\n\nA \"second wave\" of pop punk was spearheaded by Blink-182 in the late 1990s, who became a worldwide phenomenon by the turn of the century and represented the genre's mainstream peak. Other second wave acts such as New Found Glory, Sum 41 and Good Charlotte scored successful album chartings in the early 2000s. Fall Out Boy rose to the forefront of both emo pop and pop punk shortly thereafter, but the genre generally waned in popularity by the late 2000s. The genre still retains a smaller but dedicated following, and the Vans Warped Tour and the mall chain store Hot Topic are closely associated with the genre.","songs":[{"id":"b4CzHccd97","name":"Innocence","artist":"cmjk2cad8"},{"id":"eXPOx37169","name":"Wake Me Up When September Ends ","artist":"SGQd9a08"},{"id":"OI838742c","name":"Pieces","artist":"6ix8e41d"},{"id":"U5Jce7267b2","name":"Cool Kids","artist":"xFsS8p9b75e"},{"id":"b4ENyccb57","name":"Welcome To The Black Parade","artist":"6hs92cf3"},{"id":"jkiSae864","name":"在路上","artist":"dwk88e88"},{"id":"U7NH0n3fb33","name":"Youngblood","artist":"xgtVxOa5abc"},{"id":"8FZJ0ff1ca0","name":"Two Is Better Than One","artist":"d3dX3c427"},{"id":"mQ42mj64a29","name":"Perfect","artist":"7DU77d61"},{"id":"U7tabX2ce83","name":"长相厮守","artist":"bjBVb485e"},{"id":"b4GYL145d7","name":"Crazy","artist":"6jN6d43d"},{"id":"xLz6K1a01f7","name":"Ain't It Fun","artist":"7z86f42d"}],"albums":[{"id":"f3xw581e7","name":"American Idiot","artist":"SGQd9a08"},{"id":"jgblce4e1","name":"The Best Damn Thing","artist":"cmjk2cad8"},{"id":"vG2o268a8","name":"Let Go","artist":"cmjk2cad8"},{"id":"nVEPefb9c","name":"21st Century Breakdown","artist":"SGQd9a08"},{"id":"jGnz9f8f5","name":"8 Years Of Blood, Sake And Tea...","artist":"6ix8e41d"},{"id":"jgllb0a36","name":"The Black Parade","artist":"6hs92cf3"},{"id":"eTSh89a6b","name":"Under My Skin","artist":"cmjk2cad8"},{"id":"vGIb2acc7","name":"Chuck","artist":"6ix8e41d"},{"id":"jOZB9cb10","name":"21 Guns","artist":"SGQd9a08"},{"id":"x4FVLsd64ec","name":"Diamonds","artist":"WtWdf0b3"},{"id":"7V2tY3fd833","name":"Talking Dreams","artist":"xFsS8p9b75e"},{"id":"eUhU963f7","name":"Does This Look Infected?","artist":"6ix8e41d"}],"artists":[{"id":"cmjk2cad8","name":"Avril Lavigne"},{"id":"SGQd9a08","name":"Green Day"},{"id":"btEqf8cf3","name":"Fall Out Boy"},{"id":"gbhddfe5","name":"新裤子"},{"id":"6ix8e41d","name":"Sum 41"},{"id":"cvV325faf","name":"ONE OK ROCK"},{"id":"6jN6d43d","name":"Simple Plan"},{"id":"6hs92cf3","name":"My Chemical Romance"},{"id":"i6aed795","name":"反光镜"},{"id":"7z86f42d","name":"Paramore"},{"id":"WjBc608e","name":"Good Charlotte"},{"id":"SK4bf881","name":"Ramones"}]},{"type":"style","id":"686","name":"后朋克 Post-Punk","description":"后朋克（Post Punk，简称“后朋”）：自1977年朋克革命后，在朋克的独立精神和直白表达的鼓舞下，许多乐队涌现出来。他们没有重复 Sex Pistols 的风格，而是延续了除朋克摇滚外的 Roxy Music,David Bowie,和T.Rex的道路，进入到一种更具实验性质的领域，形成了后朋克风格。部分乐队因其反文化精神和对既定的摇滚习俗的反抗而联合在一起，许多这样的组织----如 Joy Division，The Cure----用合成器和吉他创造了一种黑暗、阴郁的音乐表达形式。其他的乐队则尝试着做轻音乐，但是旋律和歌词不协调，颠覆了传统摇滚/朋克的歌曲结构。到了80年代，后朋克最终演变成为一种选择性的摇滚/朋克音乐。\n\n后朋克和朋克虽只一字之差，实质上有质的差别，音乐复杂严肃、富有挑战性和创新意识，音乐内涵极具有深度。它拥有的只是音乐本身，仅此而已。于是就有了这样的说法：如果说朋克试图毁灭整个世界，那么后朋克希望毁灭的只是他们自己。\n\n后朋克比朋克更加艺术化（The Fall），也更加黑暗晦涩(Joy Division)，它甚至和根源摇滚的关系都不非常密切。划分风格是件费力不讨好的事，尤其是对后朋克这样一个非常模糊的概念。后朋克表现出的“离经叛道”比朋克更加坚决，而且也要智慧很多，在后朋克看来反主流摇滚、反传统、反文化是一项极富创造性的艺术，而且他们善于通过这种破坏的艺术使自己与众不同——他们是清高的、自负的。\n\n后朋克野史\n\n　　由于后朋克的历史众说纷纭，这里仅列出一些说法供大家参考：\n　　历史上第一批后朋克艺人，诸如 Gang of Four、Siouxsie & the Banshees、Joy Division、Adam & the Ants 几乎同时组建于在 Sex Pistols 成名后。这些乐队仅仅继承了朋克桀骜不逊的倔强精神而没有成为Sex Pistols的过剩复制品。在音乐上，他们体现出令人难以置信的复杂和试验特色。抛开了朋克粗糙的三和弦，作品充满艺术性、挑战性和高精尖的音乐素材。鉴于他们反主流摇滚、反传统、反文化的朋克精神，他们开始被叫作后朋克。这些乐队各有特点，Gang of Four尖锐的左派政治立场和凶猛的吉他噪音。Siouxsie & the Banshees 和 Adam & the Ants 喜欢使用大量的刺耳键盘、生硬的吉他。萧瑟凄惨的 Joy Division 的早期专辑《Unknown Pleasures》和《Closer》更是被看作歌特摇滚最初的奠基石之一。1978年， Pere Ubu 推出了一张令人跌破眼镜的专辑《The Modern Dance》，乐队摒弃了当时正在流行的以 The Yardbirds 和 The Who 为代表的城市布鲁斯摇滚，向着一个相反的音乐方向做出了第一次尝试。几年后，当新浪潮波及美国时，美国也很快拥有了自己的成功的后朋克乐队 Devo——表现出独特的漫不经心、内向、艺术气质。\n　　后朋克乐队数量有限，商业成绩平平，而且多已作古。Devo之所以会获得成功，在很大程度上应该感谢乐队古怪离奇的表演服饰，MTV这个公认的音乐白痴正是看中了这一点才注意到了这支的乐队。与此同时，大多数的后朋克艺人则根本无人问津，在地下世界沉沦（如 The Feelies、The Residents）。\n　　80年代初，后朋克试图和新浪潮的其它音乐划清界线。它的特立独行和不解风情从一开始就注定了它追随者的命运——大多数乐队极为短命。即使Adam & the Ants、Siouxsie & the Banshees、The Cure 这样的中坚力量也在逐渐发生变化，逐渐收敛了攻击性，转向更加纯粹的艺术性、娱乐性。后朋克第一次浪潮随着Joy Division的Ian Curtis的自杀和Bauhaus的解散而逐渐让位给新生代的代表艺人，The Birthday Party、The Fall、Pop Group、Echo & the Bunnymen、Teardrop Explodes 虽然依然可以划分在后朋克的大范畴内，但实际上音乐大相径庭了，总不能拿欢快滑稽的 The Fall 和浪漫忧郁的 Echo & the Bunnymen 相提并论吧？\n　　后朋克在80年代中期开始没落，R.E.M.的崛起标志着后朋克在美国最终完成了向另类摇滚的转变。它的后来者中，Sonic Youth、Pixies等一批出色的艺人在不断的努力下最终走出了地下世界，在 90 年代使另类摇滚成功主流化。在英国，后朋克代表人物逐渐转向了 The Smiths 和 Jesus & the Mary Chain。前者确立了英国80年代独立摇滚，终结了合成器的新浪潮时代，重新树立了吉他为主的摇滚乐。后者则延续了英国摇滚驾驭噪音摇滚的天赋，用实验音乐的视角让后朋克得到了进一步发展。先前的后朋克乐队依然有不俗的表现，Siouxsie & the Banshees、Nick Cave和Love& Rockets（Bauhaus后身）、The Fall、The Cure、New Order（Joy Division后身）顺利地进入 90 年代，成为铭记后朋克运动的里程碑。\n\nPost-punk is a rock music movement with its roots in the late 1970s, following on the heels of the initial punk rock explosion of the mid-1970s. The genre retains its roots in the punk movement but is more introverted, complex and experimental.

To attempt to nail down a singular standard for all Emo here would be folly, as no such thing exists. The unifying factor that makes emo (short for emotional) what it is, is a determination to use deeply personal and sincerely expressed feelings the central theme, whether that be through furious anger and personal climax or by heartfelt confession and poetic crooning. \nThere is general agreement that the origins of Emo grew out of the Washington, D.C. area Hardcore Punk scene, as former punk rockers looked for new forms of expression and formed the bands Rites of Spring and Embrace. The scene quickly spread to California, then across the landscape. The early Emo scene (1984-1989) sound featured mid-tempo, rock based guitar with an occassional flourish riff, and punk vocals that were sung rather than yelled. Emo was at this point still largely underground. \n\nA second wave of emo bands like Moss Icon emerged around the turn of the decade, and introduced new elements to the sound. The quiet/loud dynamic became popular, as well as catchy riff based songs featuring octave chords, pop song structure, and more mainstream, clean vocals. It could be argued that the genre's first breakout band was Sunny Day Real Estate, and this style of Emo is what has stuck in many people's heads as definitive of the style, although during this same period bands like Mohinder were playing a more abrasive, punkish Emo featuring staccato, distortion-wracked music over screamed vocals. A divergence was already apparent. \n\nFrom the mid-90s onward, this style of indie/post-rock-leaning Emo remained the larger sect, and spawned armies of like-minded bands. Though far removed from its roots, this incarnation has expanded the Emo fanbase into a major demographic as groups like The Get Up Kids and Dashboard Confessional carry the style toward the pop commercialism that its originators detested.","songs":[{"id":"8GfyAQ1cdf5","name":"I Need A Friend Tonight","artist":"c2gv2aeb4"},{"id":"xLpukLc7530","name":"Hurricane","artist":"efSI44b9a"},{"id":"PWN385d79","name":"Shoreline","artist":"8iR7b782"},{"id":"enJEy4f0cc","name":"Cue the Sun!","artist":"bOk22000c"},{"id":"cQUtK2064b","name":"Jesus","artist":"W5C99bde"},{"id":"cW2Fb2115d","name":"Walk Away ","artist":"cvbp29c3a"},{"id":"mQ3LeH6e942","name":"Silence","artist":"beUvc1476"},{"id":"8GcSvvfe53a","name":"Baby Blue Eyes","artist":"EE758efd"},{"id":"cQ8Sm1fbf9","name":"Monsoon","artist":"Wh0c2dd5"},{"id":"8HMZTP19a78","name":"电动少女","artist":"neHuf29fe"},{"id":"b9NEBca2a6","name":"Mile Away","artist":"beiqbe1af"},{"id":"mQ3oAo7097a","name":"The World Calling","artist":"XSh970c7"}],"albums":[{"id":"fGgD628c6","name":"This Is War","artist":"7o073260"},{"id":"ob0Df5718","name":"你要的我都有","artist":"beUvc1476"},{"id":"nmTmjw6d885","name":"Chinese Football","artist":"neHuf29fe"},{"id":"ktFGcc3e3","name":"Young Pilgrim","artist":"c2gv2aeb4"},{"id":"jkyF16736","name":"A Beautiful Lie","artist":"7o073260"},{"id":"oYm5220623","name":"35xxxv","artist":"cvV325faf"},{"id":"9czmJkee6b3","name":"35xxxv (Deluxe Edition)","artist":"cvV325faf"},{"id":"n0pV171f6","name":"All the Houses Look the Same","artist":"8iR7b782"},{"id":"fbVjdce84","name":"Goodnight, Witness Light","artist":"bOk22000c"},{"id":"eVHV6b4ad","name":"The Devil and God Are Raging I...","artist":"W5C99bde"},{"id":"kw6m9931b","name":"Deas Vail","artist":"8iR7b782"},{"id":"nUmff7d1c","name":"No More Days to Waste","artist":"cvbp29c3a"}],"artists":[{"id":"btEqf8cf3","name":"Fall Out Boy"},{"id":"cvV325faf","name":"ONE OK ROCK"},{"id":"7o073260","name":"30 Seconds to Mars"},{"id":"7z86f42d","name":"Paramore"},{"id":"bk2abf0a1","name":"SPYAIR"},{"id":"neHuf29fe","name":"Chinese Football"},{"id":"WVp9ab62","name":"The All-American Rejects"},{"id":"Wh0c2dd5","name":"Tokio Hotel"},{"id":"zCLf310b6","name":"MY FIRST STORY"},{"id":"XpQ9b9ad","name":"The Used"},{"id":"bptBb8d66","name":"[Alexandros]"},{"id":"beUvc1476","name":"小熊饼干"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3302","name":"电子核 Electronicore","description":"电子核结合了旋律金属核、迷幻舞曲、流行朋克、合成器流行等多种风格，最主要的吉他和鼓仍然继承自旋律金属核，并常常同时采用清嗓和死嗓，唱段及副歌编排通常较为简单，贯穿全曲的迷幻舞曲段落是其显著特点之一，有时甚至盖过金属部分，人声通常用autotune处理过，或采用流行朋克式清嗓。breakdown的运用也非常多，旋律金属核的部分反而相对不明显。代表乐队包括Attack Attack!、Asking Alexandria、Abandon All Ships。\n\nElectronicore (also known as synthcore, or simply electronic hardcore) describes a stylistic fusion of post-hardcore and metalcore with electronic music, specifically electronica.

In addition to electronica, the fusion may involve a variety of other electronic music genres, including techno, trance, dubstep, electro, and dance.","songs":[{"id":"xL8cRb97794","name":"Let Me Hear","artist":"bB7Ye5f78"},{"id":"mQ8zzN59bd1","name":"Omen","artist":"GIo952c3"},{"id":"mQCURd56ffd","name":"Another Nightmare","artist":"eGrEba7b3"},{"id":"xLoYudce962","name":"Final Episode (Let's Change The Channel)","artist":"bgV5d7ede"},{"id":"b1pNlVe42719","name":"To Plant A Seed","artist":"cvXM2c1bc"},{"id":"xLpVFt1540d","name":"Murder Avenue","artist":"Ipz82375"},{"id":"UOhf885f1","name":"Stick Stickly","artist":"bfmMd280a"},{"id":"xLtTj5af72c","name":"Intro(teleportation)","artist":"egbF451b3"},{"id":"xLrRrQc3e72","name":"Guardian Angel","artist":"bknobaa4d"},{"id":"xLpfCGdfff1","name":"Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence","artist":"bhe7adc8d"},{"id":"bqv2iGG36139","name":"Party Time","artist":"mZhq9R7182d"},{"id":"mQOaBW8c01d","name":"Crystals","artist":"dqMU35577"}],"albums":[{"id":"mikQ8f95803","name":"Let Me Hear","artist":"bB7Ye5f78"},{"id":"kobNd3fdc","name":"The Dream The Space","artist":"GIo952c3"},{"id":"khTB10e48","name":"Dance & Scream","artist":"bB7Ye5f78"},{"id":"cYlLsqd01b5","name":"Crystals","artist":"dqMU35577"},{"id":"jQzQbdb0e","name":"Stand Up And Scream","artist":"bgV5d7ede"},{"id":"DmD748db7","name":"The Artificial Theory For The ...","artist":"GIo952c3"},{"id":"JDkzG123d6a","name":"PHASE 2","artist":"bB7Ye5f78"},{"id":"krVBa2ed4","name":"NEXTREME","artist":"bB7Ye5f78"},{"id":"5Crs3b48a","name":"A Jury Of Wolves","artist":"eGrEba7b3"},{"id":"goPX7d335","name":"Just Awake","artist":"bB7Ye5f78"},{"id":"gyuo52e6a","name":"Zion","artist":"GIo952c3"},{"id":"Dpkv47ff2","name":"To Plant a Seed","artist":"cvXM2c1bc"}],"artists":[{"id":"bB7Ye5f78","name":"Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas"},{"id":"GIo952c3","name":"Crossfaith"},{"id":"bgV5d7ede","name":"Asking Alexandria"},{"id":"cvXM2c1bc","name":"We Came As Romans"},{"id":"bfmMd280a","name":"Attack Attack"},{"id":"dqMU35577","name":"Eskimo Callboy"},{"id":"GRb7b2a0","name":"I See Stars"},{"id":"bgvZd6122","name":"The Word Alive"},{"id":"eHH184ab5","name":"Issues"},{"id":"URUzfb2a5b9","name":"Hyper Slash"},{"id":"Ipz82375","name":"Dying Diva"},{"id":"eGrEba7b3","name":"Outline In Color"}]},{"type":"style","id":"913","name":"硬核朋克 Hardcore Punk","description":"硬核朋克是朋克摇滚中最强硬最极端的一个变种.属于极端摇滚。\n硬核朋克诞生于七十年初，它把朋克摇滚进一步引向极端——更快、更噪、更僵硬的演奏，喊叫式的演唱、邋遢肮脏的录音效果（有时也包括专辑封套）。这种音乐极其之快速，旋律简单,录制质量水平不高,歌手简直就是在叫喊,叠句很简单,作品看起来(或者听起来)就像是在在什么人家的地下室里录制的.大多数这类乐队相互之间听起来都相似得另人难以置信,但也多少有一些带有与众不同的声音抛在身后,而仅仅保留其观念.\n硬核朋克最初产生于美国,主要是一种美国的现象,并且主要集中在洛杉矶和纽约地区,但在美国的全境内还有一些小规模的零星分布,先后涌现了BlackFlag、HuskerDu、Descendents、MeatPuppets、DeadKennydys、BadBrains等著名的硬核乐队。\n而硬核在整个领域的影响面之广，是很少有风格可以望其项背的。\n\n硬核的发展甚至影响了整个八十年代的金属圈子，启发了整个黄金时代。当时几乎每种风格的发展都渗透着HardCore的影子，尽管有的很多喜欢技术派的人不愿意承认，可激流金属本身就是硬核与传统金属的结合产物。启发了激流金属的元老VENOM的，早期激流金属乐队EXODUS，甚至荷兰死亡金属元老THANATOS，美国老派死亡金属乐队Nunslaughter等一干早期乐队，都在接受采访时承认他们曾受到过硬核的影响。\n甚至一些激流金属乐队干脆加强了自己编曲中的硬核成分，造就了Crossover这一激流金属中非常重要的风格。\nWitches Hammer这样的加拿大地下硬核乐队也曾经坦言，80年代早期你能在加拿大罗斯湾看到身着Slayer服装的鸡冠头，激流金属演出现场也经常聚集一些喜欢硬核的人。因为有着同样疯狂的Riff。在现场音乐界限很模糊。而金属和硬核的分家直到1986年才开始。\n.核心朋克继续出现在90年代,而且继续没有汇入主流圈子,可是一些受到\"核心朋克美学\"影响的乐队包括Nirvana为代表的一批新人成为90年代主要的摇滚明星,而早期的那些核心朋克乐手如Bob Mould,Henry Rollins,Mike Watt,Ian McKaye和Dinosaur Jr.乐队的J Mascis却转变成了另类音乐的偶像,核心朋克的不少观念和特点也被其他不少同时代的风格吸收和转化(如重金属和电子乐领域).另外,核心朋克还有一个更加快速,吵闹,非旋律性,有暴力倾向和白人至上主义倾向的分支——\"Oi\".\n硬核朋克虽然对以后众多的摇滚风格产生了深远的影响，但一直没有主流化，这种情况一直持续到了今天。\n\nHardcore Punk (often referred to as simply Hardcore) is a derivation of Punk Rock that appeared during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Hardcore initially borrowed much from Punk's original music framework and energy and made it faster, heavier and more aggressive, while retaining Punk's anti-establishment image and DIY ethics/practices. Other common characteristics include an extensive use of yelling and/or screaming, a stripped-down style of production (also inherited from many earlier Punk acts) and the prevalence of short-length songs. \n\nHardcore Punk has been associated with the releases of independently-run record labels such as Dischord Records, SST Records, and Alternative Tentacles, and acts such as Adolescents, Bad Brains, Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Dead Kennedys, Fear, The Germs, Minor Threat, and Scream. While in its beginnings the genre was mainly a phenomenon rooted in the American underground music circuit, the term has also been applied to the works of non-U.S. bands from this era. These include D.O.A. from Canada; Discharge, G.B.H. and Rudimentary Peni from the United Kingdom and a Japanese Hardcore scene represented by groups like G.I.S.M. and The Stalin. \n\nThe genre would eventually splinter into other subgenres and derivative forms in a similar manner as Punk Rock did, some of which still remain rooted in the original Hardcore style. The interest of several Hardcore Punk musicians in various Metal genres played an important role in the creation of various new styles, exemplified by Crossover Thrash, Crust Punk, Grindcore, Metalcore, and New York Hardcore. The dissatisfaction of various Hardcore-rooted and associated musicians by the constraints of the genre and their growing attention for diverse forms of music (including Jazz, Experimental Rock, Dub, Funk and Post-Punk) derived in the creation of Post-Hardcore, which sought to experiment with the Hardcore template and dynamics. The focus given by some bands to melodic exploration would result in Melodic Hardcore. Beatdown Hardcore would be the result of much more slower tempos and increased breakdowns. \n\nAlthough Hardcore Punk has mantained cult status for most of its existence, it has been seminal for the development of several other (and more popular) genres, many of them outside of Punk Rock. Examples include Grunge, Pop Punk, Sludge Metal, Riot Grrrl, Alternative Metal and Thrash Metal (itself an influence for several Hardcore Punk styles).","songs":[{"id":"xL0AdI14661","name":"Never Gave

Metalcore","description":"也叫硬核金属，融合了极端金属和硬核朋克的音乐风格， 金属核是如同定义新金属一样困难的事情。金属核乐队往往混杂着很多金属风格，最初大家称呼金属核为 Crossover Thrash，最早使用这种名字是在1980年Dirty Ritten imbelcile的同名专辑，该风格的早期开拓者还有Nuclear Assault，Sucidal Tendencies等等。\n\n但到目前为止，Crossover和Metalcore已经是两种不同的风格，前者是单纯的混合，而后者则是一种稍慢的，够厚重的，以硬核朋克为根基的极端金属。\n\n尽管现在人们认为他们更偏重于金属，Nuclear Assult是第一支自称金属/硬核的乐队。另外一面，很多没被认为是金属核的但深受金属影响的硬核乐队，诸如Biohazard，Madball，Raw Deal早期的专辑为现在的金属核奠定了深厚的基础。这些乐队的多数歌曲和New York Hardcore类似，但是他们的音乐却更金属，特别是大量使用的双踩，重型RIFF，嘶吼，强烈失真等等。金属核的这种基本形式带来了他们的两个绰号：\"硬汉硬核\"，这是因为他们的歌词有时像老硬核乐队一样呼唤人性，有时却以暴力为主；\"Moshcore\"，这是因为他们大量使用breakdown。\n\n在90年代中期，金属核开始慢慢扩张。最早的例子就是来自欧洲的从声名狼藉的H8000现象发迹的Liar和Congress。H8000现象是在比利时西佛兰德斯兴起的，随后很多乐队追随他们的脚步比如Sektot，Regression，Spineless等等，他们造就了金属核这个名词。在美国，Rorschah，Starkweather，Adamantium，Deadguy开始尝试创作没有结构性，不和谐，不同于传统的音乐。加上自称用Slayer的东新玩硬核的小子Converge，他们这些乐队使金属核迅速的发展为混合了硬核，金属，前卫纯器乐，实验电子的音乐，而人们这时候称他们为朋克金属。\n\n从90年代末，特别是2000年，金属核不可想象的开始成长。各大主要唱片公司开始挖掘金属核。07年的As I Lay Dying，06年Unerath的 III以及众多金属核专辑都在公告牌取得了不错的成绩。受到歌德堡旋死影响的金属核开始大受欢迎，目前最受欢迎的金属核乐队很多都是这类被称为Swedecore的乐队，协调的主音，凶残的节奏和主唱成为了基本元素。另外Norma jean这一派乐队则继续着Roarchah等乐队的事业，形成了更进一步的噪音核。还有一些从死金转型而立或者深受死金影响的乐队发展的死核，如Red Chord，Emmure。这些乐队给金属核带来了更广阔的空间，他们的作品实验型更强，打破了已往音乐的形式。而从死核走出的Between the Buried and me的新专辑也表现出更多的前卫金属的端倪。再有一些Groove metal/Nu Metal乐队像Chimaira，LOG，也开始走向金属核，Spineshank，Coalchamber干脆解散重组。有些更偏重于hardcore的如Hatebreed，Carpthain，Bury You Dead的乐队更强调breakdown的乐队也走出了和以上乐队不一样的路线。\n\n新金属中的金属核\n\n这一派别实际上和说唱毫无关系，而且有些乐队还对说唱金属表现出一定程度上的厌恶（Slipknot就曾对LB表示过不满）。他们沿袭的是Pantera、Fear Factory、Machine Head等前辈的路线，同时又融合了其他的音乐元素，比如另类金属、激流金属以至死亡金属等。但因为多数乐队省去了solo、编排也多半更简单，并且大量的应用了电声，因此并不是特别金属，仍然显得新潮和时髦；这也和后来NWOAHM中的那些同样可以被称作Metalcore的乐队有差别。最早被归在了新金属当中的Metalcore是谁？也许就是Slipknot吧——这也是这个阵容里最成功的乐队。Slipknot的Slipknot这张唱片宣布了一股新力量的诞生。乐队在专辑中融合了Metalcore、Industry、Thrash、Death-Metal等多种成分，而特别的装束和9人的阵容也成为了乐队的标志。乐队随即成为商业上最成功的乐队之一而被人指责，但起码这张唱片是伟大的——如果你单单因为它商业就抵制它，那你就大错特错了——它和说唱金属完全是两回事。其实这一类型的新金属乐队的走红已经是在九十年代中后期了，也许是说唱金属已经不能满足乐迷的口味，这种风格才会一夜“暴富”，成为新金属中的新力量吧。Roadrunner公司成为这一流派乐队集中的重要厂牌（公司也因此在死硬乐迷群中得到了很不好的名声），它签下的乐队都还是值得一听的，除了上面说过的Slipknot外，个人还尤其推荐Soulfly（充满着死亡金属的质感和南美民族特色）、Coal Chamber。另外Mudayne也是个十分优秀的乐队，其首张专辑L。D。50是一张需要时间来消化、有一定深度的专辑，你若要指责新金属的技术和编排，先听听这张专辑再说话。这个阵容就和传统重金属更亲近，因此在新浪潮袭来的时代，这个派别的乐队可以说是应变最灵活的，他们纷纷加入激流、旋律死元素，完成了向Nu-Thrash的转变，从新金属的残兵成为新浪潮的弄潮儿。另外我一直认为如果没有这一批乐队让年轻乐迷的口味变得更重而并不仅仅限于说唱金属，之后的新浪潮运动是难以成大流的。虽然这些乐队被视为新金属，但他们和后来的好多NWOAHM乐队是有共同的根基的。从某种意义上说，他们也是重金属回潮的铺路人。\n\n重要乐队：Slipknot、Mushroom Head、Mudvayne、Coal Chamber、Spineshank、Soulfly、Kittie、Down the sun、Flaw、Ultraspank、As I lay Dying、Trivium、the GazettE（日本）等","songs":[{"id":"xLpwWLdaeae","name":"Tears Don't

Screamo","description":"Screamo（有译作情绪核）是一种硬核朋克（Hardcore punk）的子类型，大多承袭于情感核这种音乐类型，与其他在1990年代的音乐。“Screamo”这个词源先是用在1991年发展于美国圣地牙哥一些比较激进的情感核乐团，他们利用曲长较短的创作，结合抽搐般的强度来刻意实验出不和谐与力度变化。\n\n说起Screamo就不得不提到情感核，虽然大多数Screamo乐队很反感外界对他们的身世探究，而且一直可以在音乐和感情上与情感核保持着相当的距离。但是，他们无法消除情感核在他们的音乐中烙下的“胎记”，以至于他们永远无法摆脱令他们深恶痛绝的卑贱血统和“私生子”身份。\n\n1984年，华盛顿的地下摇滚乐圈浮现出了一支背离传统曲风的朋克/硬核乐队《春天的祭礼》（Rites of spring），乐队主唱ROS以极度情绪化的歌词，在歌曲中暴露著个人化的情感和十分危险的情绪，这种带有明显攻击性的音乐风格和令人肝肠寸断、撕心裂肺的情绪化表演方式，以及歌曲中传递出的痛苦甚至扭曲的脆弱敏感情绪，给听着带来了一种前所未有的触动。可以说“春天的祭礼”是第一支真正意义上的情感核乐队。\n\n任何一种新兴文化形式的出现直至作为一种大众文化存在下去，必将招致人们对它存在的意义和价值质疑，更何况他是以一种妥协的姿态存在着，这将招来更多的非议。一些乐评讽刺的说:情感核最为显著的特征就是“清脆响亮的吉他来复加上哭哭啼啼的歌词”。 乐迷则更加不留情面的将情感核批评为“软核”（Softcore）或者“雌性激素泛滥的朋克乐”。 而那些拒绝妥协的乐手们对抗主流文化的方式则是最为直接、最为现实也更为行之有效，那就是做出更为暴戾、更为吵闹的“噪音核”（Noisecore 情感核），或者索性从传统情感核音乐的戚戚哀哀中彻底抽身出来，创作出​​更具破坏性，更具爆发性和挑衅性，也更真实、诚恳的音乐。\n\n当时很多乐手吸收了80年代哥伦比亚州的朋克/情绪乐队如：Fugazi以及《春天的祭礼》等乐队的音乐中传递的社会和政治方面的信息和态度，产生了一批结合了金属的音色和硬核的价值观而词作上更为激烈、尖锐和痛苦的乐队，包括Earth Crisis、Neurosis以及Cave In等。 他们激发了更多的音乐人打破金属和硬核的界限，推进这两种音乐的共同发展。无论创作初衷如何，他们的行动直接促成了日后的Screamo音乐的产生。 同早期的硬核朋克一样，Screamo也出现于美国的东北部和东海岸。\n\n源自情感核的Screamo虽然带有明显的情感核痕迹，但是它的音乐的攻击性和侵略性较情感核要凶狠的多。 这类音乐中充斥着硬核急速啸叫的吉他，但音乐旋律较为流畅，而歌手则已充满挑战的尖叫，声嘶力竭的呼喊出郁结心头的苦痛苦和愤懑，这种音乐不但具有朋克和硬核的特质，并且由于乐手来自不同的音乐阵营，以及对各种音乐风格成分庞杂的汲取，以至于他们的音乐又带有深重的金属特点。 鉴于风格源头，Screamo还是要分两派。一个是更偏向朋克，比如:Thursday、Taking Back Sunday、The Used、Underoath等；另一派则是更偏向于金属，如：Atreyu、Poison The Well、Story of the year、Funeral for a friend等。 Screamo在音乐态度、审美观和价值观上虽然没有传统硬核那样蛮横，但比起鼻涕眼泪的情感核却已经足够生猛、凶悍了，歌曲词作涉及的题材也远比EMO单纯反应自杀、女人和自身苦痛经历的创作主题要开阔许多，死亡、毁灭、绝望、痛苦和混乱成为了他们音乐共同的主题。\n\n作为Screamo重要特征的尖声叫喊的演唱方式，在摇滚史上已经由来已久。现在在一些硬摇滚乐队，特别是死亡金属的一些分支流派，更是在演唱中融入呼喊、咆哮。 摇滚史上最著名的尖叫声也许应该首推The Who的主唱Roger在乐队1971年的经典歌曲《Won't get fooled again》中的原始嚎叫。 但乐迷对这种骇人的叫声却情有独钟：“在听乡村歌曲中的时候，你会期待带着硕大牛仔帽的歌手在他们的演唱中插入岳得尔调，Screamo歌手为什么就不能用血脉喷张的嘶吼来表达情绪。 当然那些Screamo乐手也不是仅仅凭借尖叫声掩盖创作能力的匮乏，正好相反，他们有着超乎其他摇滚乐手的才能。他们在歌曲中用明了而机警的诗句表达着年轻一代的悲哀和焦虑。在他们的音乐中流淌著美妙的旋律，音乐的风格也表现出于他们年龄不符的成熟与睿智。\n\n另外，乐手惊世骇俗的台风也是Screamo的一大特色。 Jonathan Dee在他发表于2003年6月29日《纽约时报》的文章《The Summer of Screamo》中这样描述The Used的主唱Bert McCracke的演出现场：“与其说他是在表演不如说是在举行向歌迷献身的宗教仪式。他倾尽了自己的感情和精力，不停的地跳跃、狂跑，最后纵身跃入台下高举双手的人群中，宛如一场献身的祭礼。”这样的感情宣泄，这样表达亲密与纯洁的冒险方式在主流音乐中是罕见的。\n\nScreamo乐队和他们的硬核、EMO前辈一样，在早期是长期处理地下状态的，只能在一些独立地下厂牌DIY一些七寸唱片。很不辛，当时很多Screamo乐队同早期的EMO乐队一样短命，通常只发行一两张七寸唱片后就销声匿迹了，这种状态持续了很多年，大大限制了Screamo作为一种新生摇滚乐流派的发展。\n\n近年，网络的传播和销售在很大程度上帮助了Screamo的流传。乐迷们通过eBay，在网上交换或是出售他们收藏的一些乐队早期作品的稀有版本，甚至是绝版唱片。这些拷贝在网上被叫买到令人瞠目结舌的价格，而这些唱片在最初发行的时候最多买到十美元。\n\nScreamo的渐趋流行于当下美国青少年厌倦了被动跟随主流文化，厌倦了老套的资本主义价值观不无关联。 “人们希望能够形成自己对事物的看法，他们希望他们听到的歌是写给他们自己的。”Atreyu的主唱Alex Varkatzas说。的确对于很多人来讲，Screamo太过于粗野，制作也过于粗糙，很难得到主流的肯定和商业上的成功。但是事实证明，在当前静如死水，走势低迷的摇滚市场，他们已经取得了广大乐迷和主流媒体的认可。更客观的是，他们的乐迷分别来自曾经老死不相来往的朋克和金属两大阵营。这种壮观的景像只在十几年前Grunge大潮兴起时间出现过。这种外界的认可正是来自他们穿做态度的诚恳，和他们音乐内容的真诚。\n\n随着Screamo的走红，“Screamo”作为一顶时髦的帽子，被兰扣在了其他任何一支EMO，后朋或者受EMO影响的硬核乐队头上。很多乐队勉为其难不清不白顶着Screamo这顶帽子，但是从某种意义上说，这并不完全是一件坏事，凭借著顶帽子，他们才得到主流的垂青，得到了大唱片公司的一纸合同。他们的成功也为后来更多的同类型乐队进军提供借鉴，铺平了道路。\n上前年Screamo已经成为一种主流的音乐形式，乐队进入主流金属杂志和使无数乐队扬名的MTV2 Headbanger's Ball节目频道。前年OZZFEST（奥兹音乐节）更像鲨鱼修道血腥味一样对Screamo做出了反应，它的第二舞台就是用来做各种新式重型音乐的演练场————1998年时的“体制崩溃“，1999年的Slipknot,以及2002年的The Used，去年大胆地邀请来一帮嚎叫着青春的年轻乐队：Atreyu、Every Time I Die、Unearth、Hatebreed以及Throwdown等。 Screamo显然已杀入了严肃的重型音乐圈。\n\nScreamo is an intense offshoot of Emo that began in the early 1990s. It merges the emotional lyrics and melodicism of Emo with the intensity, aggression and speed of Hardcore Punk. Songs tend to be short in length but complex in structure, often featuring many changes in tempo and rhythm. As such, the style shares some similarities with Powerviolence, another hardcore punk subgenre that developed around the same time. Important screamo bands include Saetia, Heroin, Orchid, and pageninetynine. In later years the term \"Screamo\" has been used by the mainstream to describe modern Post-Hardcore and Metalcore bands, and as these genres are very different from the word's original definition many screamo fans have adopted the term \"Skramz\" as a classification instead to avoid confusion. The term \"emoviolence\", which has been used to describe particularly powerviolence-infused bands, is also used as an alternative name. \nScreamo has continued evolving and introducing new stylistic elements since the genre's birth - in particular, many bands have integrated prominent influences and elements from Post-Rock into their sound. Popular examples of this include Envy and Circle Takes the Square.","songs":[{"id":"LySYb7a7a","name":"Decembers","artist":"c9PM2d876"},{"id":"xLouCedce3a","name":"You're Not Alone","artist":"WJGd18a4"},{"id":"xLAVSccb6a6","name":"Forgotten Souls","artist":"FRSd0e1e"},{"id":"mQFfws59cec","name":"Lust Of The Lost","artist":"vzsz26ea5"},{"id":"xLpg0Ka8402","name":"History","artist":"cmMH27a82"},{"id":"b1pNWwN40888","name":"Second & Sebring","artist":"I1q9edec"},{"id":"LzaD4c052","name":"Lost and Found","artist":"TMndec74"},{"id":"b9JWE14652","name":"Toxic","artist":"WJXbd880"},{"id":"eTmrq39247","name":"Apology","artist":"7pb961ed"},{"id":"8G1eeYfb492","name":"The Black","artist":"bgV5d7ede"},{"id":"mQDrq4700ad","name":"Americans","artist":"ear1484d8"},{"id":"mQ81RX88dcf","name":"The Burden (Interlude)","artist":"bOnq23b99"}],"albums":[{"id":"iTOG11c46","name":"Discovering the Waterfront","artist":"btNie2554"},{"id":"eW2c5204e","name":"Saosin","artist":"WJGd18a4"},{"id":"dfHJwwc13fe","name":"Younger Dreams","artist":"FRSd0e1e"},{"id":"kgwX9db73","name":"What Separates Me from You","artist":"YjWb1120"},{"id":"eHFy90f90","name":"If Only You Were Lonely","artist":"c9PM2d876"},{"id":"nnqJZh77d05","name":"The Fallen Crimson","artist":"ZJpc08dd"},{"id":"9cz2Bse9233","name":"The Black","artist":"bgV5d7ede"},{"id":"x09Np2b5df2","name":"Two Faced Charade","artist":"vzsz26ea5"},{"id":"kFDld73b7","name":"Dead Years","artist":"ear1484d8"},{"id":"kAyub6547","name":"The North Stands for Nothing","artist":"ndBTf9ec0"},{"id":"fEb3c8de3","name":"In Search of Solid Ground","artist":"WJGd18a4"},{"id":"odqif2c6d","name":"Your History Is Mine: 2002-200...","artist":"cmMH27a82"}],"artists":[{"id":"zCLf310b6","name":"MY FIRST STORY"},{"id":"ZJpc08dd","name":"envy"},{"id":"bB7Ye5f78","name":"Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas"},{"id":"FHw6be69","name":"coldrain"},{"id":"btNie2554","name":"Silverstein"},{"id":"bhxRa0ec2","name":"VETO WAY"},{"id":"OdD90820","name":"The Plot In You"},{"id":"myVRIj7c389","name":"伟大科学家乐队"},{"id":"bfbpc5b23","name":"In Fear & Faith"},{"id":"bPzzsy74077","name":"反应堆"},{"id":"c1bU452e0","name":"Attack!

In 1977, Siouxsie and the Banshees described their music as \"cold, machine-like and passionate at the same time\" and Sounds magazine prophecised about the band: \"Listen to the cold wave roar from the '70s into the '80s\".Siouxsie and the Banshees' first album, The Scream, released in November 1978, was also pictured as \"cold wave\" by music historian Simon Reynolds. For critics, coldwave also applies to Martin Hannett's production for Joy Division, prominent in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Hannett first met Joy Division in late 1978. His first recording with the band was for the song \"Digital\" for the compilation A Factory Sample.\nEarly French punk rock groups, forerunners to the scene such as Stinky Toys, Métal Urbain and The Opposition, tried to play abroad in the late seventies.\nAnother scene of French and Belgian musicians who sang in English emerged in the early eighties. These bands were Marquis de Sade, KaS Product, Siglo XX,> Martin Dupont, Deux, Asylum Party, Twilight Ritual, Norma Loy, Pavillon 7B, Résistance, Clair Obscur, &nbsp;Richard Pinhas, Artefact, Opera Multi Steel, Trisomie 21, Lizzy Mercier Descloux and Die Form. In the late 1980s, groups such as Asylum Party, Little Nemo, Museum of Devotion and The Breath of Life continued to practice the style. The Breath of Life, according to music historian Mick Mercer, took \"some of the brighter elements of late '70s Siouxsie and the Banshees\", with \"subtle power and emotionally charged confusion\". The journalist Jean-François Bizot initially documented the scene. The original coldwave groups were generally not distributed in the United States and did not sing in English.&nbsp;\nPieter Schoolwerth describes the style of these French bands as similar as Seventeen Seconds and Faith-era The Cure.\nThe groups began to achieve mainstream coverage in France in 1980 when Patrick Zerbib wrote an article for the magazine Actuel covering Marquis de Sade, Artefact and Jacno, titled \"Les jeunes gens modernes aiment leurs mamans\" (\"The Modern Young People Love Their Mothers\").\nA recent retrospective article enumerates various stylistic and conceptual influences (translated to English):\n\"Taking advantage from the double efficiency of the do it yourself method and the provocation established by the activist strategy of experimentation which punk had permitted, the new wave recalled at the same time the historical artistic avant-gardes (constructivism, futurism, symbolism, dadaism, socialist realism), literature (romanticism, science fiction), the cinema (French New Wave, German Expressionism) and the latest advanced technologies (electronics, robotics, nuclear).\"\nWierd Records is credited with establishing interest in the style in the United States, while The Liberty Snake Club did a great deal to popularize it within the United Kingdom. The Tigersushi Records compilation So Young But So Cold, compiled by Ivan Smagghe, is one document of the scene.","songs":[{"id":"eSDgh5e850","name":"Psychic Colours","artist":"6s45fffe"},{"id":"b0lDe1550c","name":"Faith","artist":"ciHW27f4d"},{"id":"bAHQqd3560","name":"Une Attente Douleur (Mahan's Version)","artist":"cs3L29f8e"},{"id":"xLspFBb5a78","name":"Circles","artist":"K0569c24"},{"id":"mQB6V094e8a","name":"Die World","artist":"nci629f7a"},{"id":"xL3ihRd392e","name":"Play Alone","artist":"iSZVb9082"},{"id":"mQHVkf52e09","name":"Cadavres Exquis (Howard Song)","artist":"dpMtjid5a56"},{"id":"mQ4av47bc7c","name":"Discovery","artist":"baXoad666"},{"id":"xLqoyRd0bf4","name":"Life Magazine","artist":"biIOb665c"},{"id":"mQHVUJ5337e","name":"Anyway","artist":"8j1aVGfa5f6"},{"id":"bf03B732e4e5","name":"Answer","artist":"mfGy9N81bd3"},{"id":"8Gthnve6d14","name":"Good Clean Men","artist":"xq5Anfb42a4"}],"albums":[{"id":"wIm242f2e","name":"The Soft Moon","artist":"K0569c24"},{"id":"mDIrm295d42","name":"Tomb For Two","artist":"nci629f7a"},{"id":"D1c8a552","name":"Faith","artist":"ciHW27f4d"},{"id":"gsq07e850","name":"The World Is Getting Colder","artist":"nci629f7a"},{"id":"jhddd944f","name":"Inhuman","artist":"6s45fffe"},{"id":"jhcHda7bf","name":"Bach Project","artist":"6s45fffe"},{"id":"eppyi6ed8d1","name":"The Grey Years Vol. 1","artist":"iSZVb9082"},{"id":"yhSMWV9eb37","name":"Let Them Be Alien","artist":"nci629f7a"},{"id":"kD7Bb0bb8","name":"Zeros","artist":"K0569c24"},{"id":"rOEw21d78","name":"Swimming","artist":"baXoad666"},{"id":"xFKbTncf65c","name":"Cadavres Exquis (Howard Song)","artist":"dpMtjid5a56"},{"id":"jXbWb2ff8","name":"Love Comes Close","artist":"biIOb665c"}],"artists":[{"id":"nci629f7a","name":"Lebanon Hanover"},{"id":"K0569c24","name":"The Soft Moon"},{"id":"6s45fffe","name":"Die Form"},{"id":"cEU2tHba71e","name":"Forever Grey"},{"id":"iSZVb9082","name":"Asylum Party"},{"id":"xtOWfh96c8d","name":"Sixth June"},{"id":"dpMtjid5a56","name":"Little Nemo"},{"id":"mfGy9N81bd3","name":"Siglo XX"},{"id":"baXoad666","name":"The Names"},{"id":"30c7bcc6","name":"Clan of Xymox"},{"id":"biIOb665c","name":"Cold Cave"},{"id":"bbY3d2d4b","name":"Five or Six"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3226","name":"舞曲朋克 Dance-Punk","description":"Dance-punk也就是Disco-punk，产生于70年代后期，是一种将朋克、后朋精神及放克的律动性和早期迪斯科相融合的音乐风格。以纽约朋克运动为开端，更与70年代后期的无浪潮运动息息相连。代表艺术家有ESG，Lizzy Mercier Descloux，Liquid Liquid。\n\n到了21世纪，类似LCD Soundsystem、The Rapture这样的乐队将Dance-punk带入了公众的视野，这也直接引发了new rave（新锐舞）潮流，21世纪10年代中后期，英伦大地上涌现了一大批这样的乐队。\n\nDance-punk was born in the late 1970s.

Goth rock bands grew from the strong ties they had to the English punk rock and emerging post-punk scenes. According to both Pitchfork and NME, proto-goth bands are Joy Division, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus and The Cure. \n\nThe genre itself was defined as a separate movement from punk rock during the early 1980s largely due to the significant stylistic divergences of the movement; goth rock, as opposed to punk, combines dark, often keyboard-heavy music with introspective and dark lyrics. Goth rock then gave rise to a broader subculture that included clubs, fashion and numerous publications that grew in popularity in the 1980s.","songs":[{"id":"ck9bk17097","name":"Gone With The Sin","artist":"6fa5c74e"},{"id":"b38cVd113b","name":"You and Your Sister","artist":"bt10fe002"},{"id":"Lwze88e2a","name":"For Martha","artist":"SMGde714"},{"id":"TFRY91280","name":"Song to a Moonlit Mermaid","artist":"ctUz27f68"},{"id":"b1pOib03d927","name":"Endlos","artist":"bfc6b7401"},{"id":"fNwM8e4e0","name":"狂人日记","artist":"i9Ufbeac"},{"id":"bf0si0E4cc9e","name":"Bela Lugosi's Dead","artist":"2CB8ab90"},{"id":"b1eBA9e7b3","name":"Cuts You Up","artist":"SJnb1c4e"},{"id":"mQ379559fee","name":"Hong Kong Garden","artist":"SM7b3930"},{"id":"mQFg5Z7ddd6","name":"She Will","artist":"ndMff1b2d"},{"id":"NIkp6ee3e","name":"Kinski","artist":"bt1O17b09"},{"id":"xL1srId19fb","name":"The Warden","artist":"c2mg2ba53"}],"albums":[{"id":"C2YC468f2","name":"And Love Said No: The Greatest...","artist":"6fa5c74e"},{"id":"iPr0c4ac9","name":"Blood","artist":"bt10fe002"},{"id":"bUXq3234a","name":"Adore","artist":"SMGde714"},{"id":"f5zw54f5a","name":"Uneasy Listening Vol. 1","artist":"6fa5c74e"},{"id":"jfXsdc437","name":"Deep Shadows and Brilliant Hig...","artist":"6fa5c74e"},{"id":"xgg3dIc1575","name":"Tears On Tape","artist":"6fa5c74e"},{"id":"f5xm712b7","name":"The Single Collection: In Joy ...","artist":"6fa5c74e"},{"id":"9c92naff3d1","name":"House of Bullies","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"jfXobb87c","name":"Razorblade Romance","artist":"6fa5c74e"},{"id":"jCVob3db5","name":"Sentient","artist":"ctUz27f68"},{"id":"kve7d0b80","name":"Greatest Hits","artist":"6fa5c74e"},{"id":"bdgKa97b1","name":"In the Flat Field","artist":"2CB8ab90"}],"artists":[{"id":"ciHW27f4d","name":"The Cure"},{"id":"6fa5c74e","name":"H.I.M"},{"id":"UsO9c42d","name":"Lacrimosa"},{"id":"2GSeaa98","name":"Joy Division"},{"id":"SEQ9f641","name":"Cocteau Twins"},{"id":"WHD99fb6","name":"Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds"},{"id":"Ty29baa1","name":"Dead Can Dance"},{"id":"b6iSf9768","name":"Mono Inc."},{"id":"2CB8ab90","name":"Bauhaus"},{"id":"be5O9a872","name":"ALI PROJECT"},{"id":"Fdg6d18d","name":"Unheilig"},{"id":"3z25fa37","name":"Swans"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1350","name":"现代主义复兴 Mod Revival","description":"Mod 的复兴 ( Mod Revival ) 。 1979 年 Quadrophenia ( 四重人格 ) 这部由电影的上映，带起了 Mod 的复兴，片中内容讲述 1960 年代因为出生於劳工阶级的 Mods，因为无法摆脱现实的桎梏，无法摆脱自己的社会阶级，以及生活当中的苦闷，完全呈现了 Mods 的生活。本片由 The Who 监制，配乐除了使用 The Who 的 Quadrophenia 专辑当中的音乐外，还加上 Mods 最爱的黑人灵魂乐等乐风，Sting 在当中也有饰演一角。\n此片重新复兴了 Mod 精神，再次带动 Mod 风潮，而此时新的精神领袖是英国三大庞克团之一的 The Jam，被誉为新的 The Who，而其中的主唱 Paul Weller ( 保罗．威勒 ) 後来更被尊称为 Mod 之父。\n\nThe mod revival was a music genre and subculture that started in England in 1978 and later spread to other countries (to a lesser degree). The mod revival's mainstream popularity was relatively short, although its influence lasted for decades. The mod revival post-dated a Teddy Boy revival, and mod revivalists sometimes clashed with Teddy Boy revivalists, skinhead revivalists, casuals, punks and rival gang members.\nThe late 1970s mod revival was led by the band The Jam, who had adopted a stark mod look and mixed the energy of punk with the sound of early 1960s mod bands. It was heavily influenced by the 1979 film Quadrophenia (film). The mod revival was a conscious effort to harken back to the earlier generation in terms of style and presentation. In the early 1980s in the UK, a mod revival scene influenced by the original mod subculture of the 1960s developed.","songs":[{"id":"d2k6A28dce","name":"In the City","artist":"2G966d70"},{"id":"cipTzebd13","name":"Birds of a Feather","artist":"4yo74263"},{"id":"mQA5fy73e88","name":"Stop That Girl","artist":"4zS742e8"},{"id":"b2Hgvbe4f2","name":"Poison Ivy","artist":"4zF529d3"},{"id":"xLBncwc6fc6","name":"Goodbye Piccadilly","artist":"bcFlb154a"},{"id":"xMVoWhaaf21","name":"Don't Love You Anymore","artist":"9deKVje7673"},{"id":"b2MA7bba48","name":"This Is How It Ends","artist":"U1fb175d"},{"id":"ciFAe1bfec","name":"Going to a Go-Go","artist":"4zN8a090"},{"id":"mSklXpe3726","name":"Ain't Done Wrong","artist":"JXPWMp3ba46"},{"id":"gsZSX483c0","name":"Wacky Acky I Aye","artist":"bdobc128e"},{"id":"U5DFUP282df","name":"If Now Is The Answer","artist":"iQEAbe0b0"},{"id":"mQ3yDu6473a","name":"Love Is a Golden Word","artist":"U1k9b297"}],"albums":[{"id":"bedsd2acf","name":"In the City","artist":"2G966d70"},{"id":"dyi71zee49c","name":"That's Entertainment: The Coll...","artist":"2G966d70"},{"id":"jb1Na95fa","name":"Beat Boys in the Jet Age","artist":"4zF529d3"},{"id":"jboRbff03","name":"Read My Lips","artist":"4yo74263"},{"id":"jboVc07f6","name":"Simplicity","artist":"4yo74263"},{"id":"ePtM56af8","name":"Get Smart!","artist":"4zS742e8"},{"id":"biYuEc752df4","name":"长沙普洗","artist":"9dfve9edfd4"},{"id":"fvOL83f5f","name":"This Is London","artist":"bcFlb154a"},{"id":"yhNQP399140","name":"Completely Perfect","artist":"JXPWMp3ba46"},{"id":"qy7MEK925aa","name":"燃烧明天","artist":"9dfve9edfd4"},{"id":"nKgSecf9b","name":"Go! with the Times","artist":"bcFlb154a"},{"id":"yhNU9gae41b","name":"Here Comes That Feeling Again....","artist":"9deKVje7673"}],"artists":[{"id":"bByvf82c9","name":"Beady Eye"},{"id":"bCVPf18e2","name":"Miles Kane"},{"id":"2G966d70","name":"The Jam"},{"id":"dHU03c479","name":"THE MODS"},{"id":"U0ma923f","name":"The Vapors"},{"id":"4z48d50b","name":"The Chords"},{"id":"4zS742e8","name":"Squire"},{"id":"4zF529d3","name":"The Lambrettas"},{"id":"U1fb175d","name":"The Scooters"},{"id":"40j5d3c2","name":"Mood Six"},{"id":"4zN8a090","name":"Secret Affair"},{"id":"da5337323","name":"Direct Hits"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1352","name":"无浪潮 No Wave","description":"No Wave很短命，是70年代Punk音乐的一个先锋性的分支，几乎全部来源于1978到1982的New York市东部地下音乐。就象Post-Punk是以英国为中心起源的一样，No Wave则是起源于较具艺术性的Punk--但是正当英国的Post-Punk已经剧减降温并且绝望之际，No Wave却仍然在经历其刺耳，磨砺和攻城占地的阶段。大部分No Wave乐队都拥有使人神魂颠倒的可以由电吉它制造出来的纯噪音，这也是No Wave乐队音乐的重要组成部分（时常极为集中）。不象Punk那样，旋律就象乐器的技术一样不重要，大部分的No Wave音乐家人都喜欢集中他们所有的精力去制造一些无调的,不和谐的喧闹（却还算节奏感十足）。由于其喜好武力的艺术形式和戏剧性的焦虑，No Wave应该更加象一种表演艺术而非音乐。两个No Wave的中心象征：主音和吉它演奏者Lydia Lunch以及萨克斯管吹奏者James Chance，他们都在Teenage Jesus和The Jerks进行表演；Lunch进行了漫长的单飞表演生涯，而Chance则创新的开拓了No Wave和Punk的混合乐队--名叫The Contortions。而No Wave的标志性专辑应该是1978年Brian Eno录制的，而其实质的特点则来源于Chance和The Contortions, Teenage Jesus, DNA (以先锋派吉它手Arto Lindsay为象征), 和Mars。虽然没有任何No Wave艺术家们真正想过要打动更多的听众(Lunchs很多产，协作性的重型Solo让她极为接近他们)，Sonic Youth通过吉它艺术家和先锋派作曲家Glenn Branca的保证了No Wave扭曲的不和谐音能够进行更加深思熟虑的噪音实验，并成功在音乐里加进更多的旋律结构而成为了地下音乐的传奇。\n\nNo wave was an underground music, super 8 film, performance art, video art, and contemporary art scene that had its beginnings during the late 1970s through the mid-1980s in downtown New York City when the city was a wasteland of cheap rent and cheap drugs. The term \"no wave\" is in part a punk subculture satirical wordplay rejecting commercial elements in general, that was based in the specific rejection of the then-popular new wave genre. No wave music was a reaction against new wave acts, like Talking Heads, signing with record labels, and the use of Chuck Berry guitar riffs commonly used by new wave music groups in the late 1970s. The term became used in downtown New York City concurrent with the 1981 show, \"New York/New Wave\" that had been curated by the artist/curator Diego Cortez. The movement would last a relatively short time but profoundly influence the development of independent film, fashion and visual art.","songs":[{"id":"mSsMGU4dae7","name":"被观看的人（单曲版）","artist":"bfHm2zQ2dcdc"},{"id":"cjm2ve5058","name":"Cavern","artist":"Vd9b2332"},{"id":"RJ1Z574a3","name":"No Golden Throat","artist":"baJOe08fe"},{"id":"b1k3re0da0","name":"Spooky","artist":"TKpc6816"},{"id":"mQ4h5G6b4e8","name":"Rituals","artist":"bu2hfc7e8"},{"id":"xLpgH6b4595","name":"Blonde Red Head","artist":"U1Jd7938"},{"id":"xLpOIzde741","name":"Smack Jack","artist":"d06M3d163"},{"id":"Naq05a152","name":"Summertime","artist":"U15ad30c"},{"id":"8Go7nBe8e05","name":"PRPL","artist":"ckU0IQd88eb"},{"id":"gmPl34957d","name":"Orphans","artist":"da6y369f1"},{"id":"ekSo53447c","name":"Lesson No. 2","artist":"bu29245c6"},{"id":"f6QQp3f6ce","name":"Searching","artist":"U1Oc7f99"}],"albums":[{"id":"fntQ88241","name":"Press Color","artist":"baJOe08fe"},{"id":"nndYVE898d4","name":"被观看的人（单曲版）","artist":"bfHm2zQ2dcdc"},{"id":"noe8ef822","name":"Liquid Liquid","artist":"Vd9b2332"},{"id":"jRg1c081b","name":"Boom In The Night (Original St...","artist":"bu2hfc7e8"},{"id":"iT07a9e4b","name":"Queen of Siam","artist":"TKpc6816"},{"id":"Dokf48257","name":"A Taste of DNA","artist":"U1Jd7938"},{"id":"jbC7fff23","name":"Everything","artist":"da6y369f1"},{"id":"jb8xc8853","name":"Meet the Residents","artist":"U15ad30c"},{"id":"f3J16b1ac","name":"The Very Best of Nina Hagen","artist":"d06M3d163"},{"id":"8m0R3f106","name":"George & James","artist":"U15ad30c"},{"id":"fntR86497","name":"Mambo Nassau","artist":"baJOe08fe"},{"id":"jbAAa2fd1","name":"The Ascension","artist":"bu29245c6"}],"artists":[{"id":"mt4wj75a500","name":"梅卡德尔"},{"id":"bzIBeeb90","name":"Snapline"},{"id":"3z25fa37","name":"Swans"},{"id":"2CS74d64","name":"The Birthday Party"},{"id":"U15ad30c","name":"The Residents"},{"id":"TKpc6816","name":"Lydia Lunch"},{"id":"U1Kd7100","name":"Diamanda Galás"},{"id":"U1Jd7938","name":"DNA"},{"id":"baJOe08fe","name":"Lizzy Mercier Descloux"},{"id":"9dft9Xf64e7","name":"The Wasted Years"},{"id":"bu2hfc7e8","name":"Bush Tetras"},{"id":"bu29245c6","name":"Glenn Branca"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1148","name":"原型朋克 Proto-Punk","description":"原型朋克出现于60年代末期，以其沙哑的、基本无旋律的音乐著称，简单流转的吉他重复段，霸气的音乐风格，和演唱者地道的英格兰口音（这其中不包括另类音乐代表David Bowie和Roxy Music）都激发了未来朋克音乐的进一步兴盛。\n出现于1969年左右的the MC5和the Stooges以其沙哑的、基本无旋律的音乐著称，他们比其他乐队更明晰地阐述了朋克音乐风格。70年代初，the New York Dolls浮出水面，以其直白的硬摇滚音乐和迷人的形象揭开了美国纽约朋克音乐的幕角；同时，也有另一些小范围的准朋克音乐流行开来，如Patti Smith, RICHARD HELL，和Televisions Tom Verlaine。许多被认为是原型朋克的英格兰音乐人也成为迷惑摇滚的一部分，他们简单流转的吉他重复段，霸气的音乐风格，和演唱者地道的英格兰口音（这其中不包括另类音乐代表David Bowie和Roxy Music）都激发了未来朋克音乐的进一步兴盛。\n\nProto-punk is a term used retrospectively to describe a number of musicians who were important precursors of punk rock in the mid-1960s to mid-1970s, or who have been cited by early punk musicians as influential.

The sound of skate punk is typified by fast tempos and extensive use of riffing and licks influenced by '50s/'60s Surf Rock. The lyrical content of Skate Punk is often comical, anti-establishment, and/or absurdist in nature, sometimes with political or cultural overtones due to the hardcore punk influence. Skate Punk has also shown to be a strong influence to modern Pop Punk.","songs":[{"id":"OI838742c","name":"Pieces","artist":"6ix8e41d"},{"id":"LkTD4e504","name":"Why Don't You Get a Job?","artist":"2IH7c9d6"},{"id":"LKoN53102","name":"All the Small Things","artist":"bt7Xed458"},{"id":"On7Y6ad64","name":"Bob","artist":"T7Kcb9f9"},{"id":"L0n651ba5","name":"Subliminal","artist":null},{"id":"8HLXRwebe7c","name":"Life Is Already Like a Shit","artist":"byn09N4fc53"},{"id":"xNhe8ob5d51","name":"Morning Whisper","artist":"9dfss918848"},{"id":"KU1X90682","name":"Before I Go","artist":"3CG68168"},{"id":"JD8SLB1ece9","name":"She`s A Timebomb","artist":"yi1oVbc4fa2"},{"id":"mSYMpQ75522","name":"AM I WRONG ？","artist":"yhRuHXb2cd5"},{"id":"mSY01o648d0","name":"Progress Daily","artist":"yiyKHf9fed5"},{"id":"Kv477bf47","name":"The Blood & the Sweat","artist":"T8e13706"}],"albums":[{"id":"vGIb2acc7","name":"Chuck","artist":"6ix8e41d"},{"id":"be6Jabb0a","name":"Americana","artist":"2IH7c9d6"},{"id":"iQHjd1580","name":"Enema of the State","artist":"bt7Xed458"},{"id":"jYXbaf494","name":"Greatest Hits","artist":"bt7Xed458"},{"id":"iQHib1b7b","name":"Dude Ranch","artist":"bt7Xed458"},{"id":"eE8e86412","name":"Buddha","artist":"bt7Xed458"},{"id":"eEGe50057","name":"White Trash, Two Heebs and a B...","artist":"T7Kcb9f9"},{"id":"eE8f88a40","name":"Cheshire Cat","artist":"bt7Xed458"},{"id":"eEGh90404","name":"Punk in Drublic","artist":"T7Kcb9f9"},{"id":"b5gn16fc5","name":"Suicidal Tendencies","artist":"dOTT48736"},{"id":"iQPkc6986","name":"I Heard They Suck Live","artist":"T7Kcb9f9"},{"id":"USgrPc41962","name":"Whisper","artist":"9dfss918848"}],"artists":[{"id":"bt7Xed458","name":"Blink-182"},{"id":"2IH7c9d6","name":"The Offspring"},{"id":"T7Kcb9f9","name":"NOFX"},{"id":"3Ji8d525","name":"D.R.I."},{"id":"T8e13706","name":"Sick of It All"},{"id":"byn09N4fc53","name":"MonkeyShine"},{"id":"yizHEab9cc8","name":"倒刺Hangnail"},{"id":"3CG68168","name":"Unwritten Law"},{"id":"T8kdeead","name":"The Vandals"},{"id":"bC7DkJS48f0d","name":"Street Rats"},{"id":"yiyKHf9fed5","name":"Transatlantic Airwaves"},{"id":"9dfss918848","name":"HELLO FRANKY"}]}]},{"type":"genre","id":"7","name":"世界音乐 World Music","description":"世界音乐是西方角度观点的词汇，意思指非英、美及西方民歌 /流行曲的音乐，通常指发展中地区或落后地区的传统音乐，例如非洲及南亚洲地区的音乐，有些地区如拉丁美洲的音乐，则能普及到自成一种类型。今天大家说的 World Mmusic通常是指与西方音乐混和了风格的、改良了的传统地区音乐。非洲的 KING SUNNY ADE，东欧的DON BYRON，中国的朱哲琴，巴基斯坦的 NUSRAT FATEHALI KAHN等是西方乐迷较熟悉的World Mmusic乐手。\n　　世界音乐（World Music），一种多元文化的混合、三种不同音乐的结晶，为流行音乐的发展带来了一次巨大的腾飞。从概念上分析，世界音乐可以有两种说法：一种是广义的世界音乐，泛指世界各国的民族音乐；另一种是狭义的概念，即本文的主题，民族音乐、传统音乐与流行音乐相结晶的混合体。自二十世纪八十年代以来，世界音乐的概念在流行音乐中不断的得到提升，慢慢地它变成了一种国际流行音乐的发展趋势。\n\nIn the Western world, \"World music\" refers either to music that doesn't fall into the North American and British pop or folk traditions or to hybrids of various indigenous musics.

Korean Traditional Music","description":"传统音乐，顾名思义就是保有韩国旧有节拍的音乐。有时指的也可以是韩国国乐。\n　　历史\n　　三国时代(57 B.C.-A.D. 676) 时，韩国已制造出高句丽的玄琴(类似古筝)、伽倻的伽倻琴等古典乐器，而同中国及西方国家的文化交流又将外来音乐引入了韩国。进入高丽时代，雅乐和乡乐活跃起来。雅乐，即正雅之乐，由中国传来的大晟乐演变发展而成，是宗庙祭典时演奏的宫中音乐； 乡乐则是高句丽、百济、新罗时代传承至高丽时代的音乐，指区别于雅乐和唐乐的韩国传统祭礼音乐。到了朝鲜时代(1392-1910)时代，音乐形式初、中期以宫中音乐、后期则以民俗音乐为代表。属宫中音乐的雅乐和宫中的礼仪习习相关，多于款待国宾贵客的宴席上演奏，以赞扬王室的内容为主。至15世纪，集中整理了音乐理论、历史及演奏乐器等内容的音乐理论著作《乐学轨范》得以编撰出版。而朝鲜后期，随着农业生产力的提高及工商业的发达，市民文化得到了很大发展。表现在音乐领域就是享有音乐的阶层扩大，音乐形式多样化，尤其是出现了市民创作的清唱(板索里)和民谣。民俗音乐真实地表现了当时人民的感情并对社会的不公进行了讽刺批判。这样的民俗音乐发展到后来，以四物表演等新形式出现，深受人们的喜爱。四物表演指用锣、钲(类似于锣，但声音较低沉)、长鼓(可两面敲打的鼓)和鼓四种乐器演奏的打击乐。\n　　韩国传统音乐尽管受到中国的巨大影响，还是很富于特色的。在韩国有叫做“唐乐”的韩国化的中国音乐，在日本有叫做“高丽乐”的日本化的韩国传统音乐。\n　　“唐乐”这个韩文名称的字面意思是中国唐朝的音乐。同样，“高丽乐”这个日文名称的字面意思是韩国高丽王朝的音乐。韩国传统音乐大体上可以分成两大类，一类叫“正乐”，一类叫“俗乐”，前者是统治阶级的音乐，后者是平民的音乐。这两大类又可以分成许多小类，从而构成整个韩国音乐。例如“正乐”有两种不同然而在某种程度上相互关联的意思。\n　　从广义上说，这个名称是指被认为在儒家哲学方面对韩国统治阶级“合适”的优美音乐风格，在这一广泛含意之内，这个名称也是指宫廷以外社会地位高的人的合奏音乐。在这方面，三个重要名称是“雅乐”、“唐乐”和“乡乐”。“正乐”和“雅乐”在广义上可以换用，指统治阶级的音乐，包括“唐乐”、“乡乐”和儒教礼乐。\n　　从狭义上说，“雅乐”指寺庙仪式音乐，这种音乐目前只留下一个例子，这就“文庙乐”。“文庙乐”是在文庙一祭祀孔子及其弟子的神殿一演奏的音乐。唐乐是指中国唐宋两朝的世俗音乐，这种音乐在引进韩国以后变成了宫廷音乐。乡乐只是指韩国本地音乐，一个重要的例子是“寿齐天”，这是一部器乐作品，常常听到有人说它至少有1,300年历史。\n　　这比第一次编格列高利圣咏的时间还要早。宫廷音乐是正乐的一部分，包括三种：仪式音乐、宴会音乐和军乐。\n　　仪式音乐包括儒乐和王室神殿音乐，而宴会音乐当时是气派大的宴会上的音乐。“寿齐天”是最有名的宴会音乐作品之一。原来上层阶级的音乐是一种叫做“风流”的合奏音乐（属于最复杂的韩国传统抒情歌曲一类）、“歌曲”和韩国本地流行歌曲“时调”。“风流”是一个已不通用的古词，这个词以前的意思是一般音乐，现在的字面意思是一个身心悠闲自在的人摆脱日常事务，而有一种适于欣赏诗歌、音乐和同女友交往的和谐心情。然而在联系到韩国传统古典音乐用这个字眼的时候，它是指一种供贵族享受的合奏音乐。这种音乐中有一类叫做“线风流”，主要是弦乐器。第二类叫做“竹风流”，主要是管乐器。第三类是头两类的结合。“歌曲”用一种16拍专长短（节奏），或者用一种略加改变的10拍长短（节奏）。任何“歌曲”的选择都是基于“羽调”或者“界面调”调式，有时候基于两者。用来伴奏的乐器是玄鹤琴、伽耶琴、洋琴、奚琴、笛子和杖鼓。普通人的音乐“俗乐”，包括萨满教音乐、佛教音乐、民歌、叫做“农乐”的农民音乐、一种叫做“板声”的剧歌和一种叫做“散调”的器乐独奏。在萨满教音乐中，叫做巫婆的受神灵启示的女萨满教士起很重要的作用。巫婆扮演的角色是充当现实世界和超自然世界之间的媒介。唱歌、跳舞和奏乐器总是少不了的。最重要的佛教音乐之一叫做“梵呗”，这是一种对佛的赞歌，今天只有少数教士演唱这种赞歌。为了提倡这种音乐，政府把“梵呗”定为国家文化瑰宝，并且正在采取措施来鼓励更多的人献身于这种艺术。08新年了解韩国传统文化,韩国传统音乐\n　　韩国传统音乐,韩国传统文化\n　　由于韩国历来是农业国，农民的生活一向对韩国的音乐史产生重大影响。农民音乐的最令人感兴趣的特点是它的叫做“十二彩”的12种不同的节奏型式，带头的是一面叫做“小金”的小锣。“俗乐”中比较富于吸引力的形式之一是“散调”，这是一种原来用各种乐器即席演奏的器乐独奏，这些乐器有伽耶琴、玄鹤琴、大令、奚琴、短箫和笛子。“板声”是韩国的另一种非常重要的音乐瑰宝，可以定义为剧歌，这是本地的一种歌剧式的音乐。在这种“板声”中，“旁白”是对歌曲中间的戏剧内容的口头说明。“身手动作”是戏剧的具体动作。08\n　　乐器\n　　用于传统音乐的乐器多达100多种，按演奏方法的不同分为拨弦弹奏的弦乐乐器、用嘴吹奏的管乐乐器和击打发生的打击乐器三种。\n　　• 弦乐器：伽倻琴、玄琴、洋琴(四角形板面玄琴，因自西洋传入而称洋琴)、 二胡、牙筝(7弦筝，弦乐乐器中音域最窄的低音乐器)等。\n　　• 管乐器：大笛、小笛、箫、短箫、太平箫、笙簧、喇叭、螺角、洞箫等。\n　　• 打击乐器：拍(也叫拍板，类似快板，但木板的数量为6块)、编钟、编磬、腰鼓、锣、鼓等。","songs":[{"id":"mQ7M4Y87f21","name":"Arirang","artist":"6hG7d2d1"},{"id":"mQDUk985968","name":"정선아리랑","artist":"zGEO4a5c0"},{"id":"8Gl4D1fbab8","name":"아리랑","artist":"m6glrc5eec8"},{"id":"8FZsjcf2d80","name":"백만송이

uta)则是“民谣”的意思。因此“岛呗”一词原本意思是“故乡的民谣”，而正是因为“シマ”一字特殊含义，许多奄美人不将这种歌谣写作“島唄”，而是将它写作“シマ唄”。唱岛呗的人被称作“呗者”。\n\n    由于“呗”字的发音与日本语中“歌”字的发音相同，一些中文媒体亦将“岛呗”写作“岛歌”。\n\n    岛呗与日本本土的和歌在音律上有很大的不同。与琉歌一样，岛呗的音律为8、8、8、6；与和歌的5、7、5、7、7，以及日本民谣的7、7、7、5都不相同。岛呗的音域很广。在德之岛以北地区，使用的是与日本本土相同的五声调式阳音阶(D、F、G、A、C、D)；冲永良部岛以南则使用琉球音阶(C、E、F、G、B、C)。岛呗的伴奏乐器往往是三味线。\n\n    在奄美群岛，不同地区的岛呗其风格亦不相同。例如，奄美大岛北部流行“笠利节”，其节奏平缓稳重；而南部则流行“东节”，情绪充沛，回转变化丰富。笠利节和东节是岛呗最主要的两大流派。元千岁和中孝介的演唱方式就属于东节风格。\n\n    岛呗的演唱需要类似于女性的假声，这是因为琉球群岛地区妹神(おなり神)的缘故。","songs":[{"id":"cUGgT251a2","name":"唄の島

| 演歌 Enka","description":"演歌，是日本独有的歌曲种类。是基于日本人的情感或感觉所演唱出具有娱乐性质的歌曲。由歌手独特的唱法或者是歌曲所表达的意思又有(艳歌)、(怨歌)等等的称呼。\n\n    演歌起源于明治时代，并一度在日本流行起来。但随着西方文化在日本影响力渐大，演歌的流行度已远远不及日本流行曲(J-POP)。但近年由于如冰川清志的年轻演歌歌手的出现和如早安少女组等的日本流行曲歌手也有唱演歌，所以有重新流行起来的趋势。\n\n    一般而言，在公开唱合中演歌歌手在唱演歌时会穿着和服。\n\n    演歌中所使用的音阶大多使用日本古时候的民谣采用的五音音阶(ペンタトニック・スケール)。意即，从西洋音乐的7音阶移开第4音和第7音，使用把第5音和第6音做为第4音和第5音的五音音阶，被称作为抽出4和7音的音阶法。这种音阶法由古贺正男所发扬跟普及。自此之后成为了演歌独特的音阶。在古贺旋律普及初期，由东京艺术大学的藤山一郎(声乐家增永丈夫)是为主流。直到1960年代美空云雀确定了在演歌界巨匠的地位之后，这种利用装饰音突显演歌歌手个别的个性的古贺旋律正式成为日本演歌的主流地位。\n\n    演歌中独特的唱腔，称为“装饰音(小节)”的独特的歌唱法被用得多。同时，还可以技巧性的放入“颤音”。这个2种表现的方法在演歌中是不可或缺的。\n\n    演歌歌手中，特别是女性歌手，为了加强日本的印象，常常在表演的时候穿和服。\n\n    歌词的内容里以\"海•酒•眼泪•女人•雨•北国•雪•离别\"最常被拿来使用，以这种词句为中心，来表达男女之间的悲情、悲恋等等。其中以美空云雀“悲しい酒”，都晴美“大阪しぐれ”，大川荣策略“さざんかの宿”，吉几三“雪国”等等最为代表。\n\n    就算演歌有上面所说的特征，也很难明确的分类演歌跟其他流行歌曲。一般认为譬如爵士乐钢琴家山下洋辅就曾经说过不能用“音乐理论性的观点”来分类两者。\n\n 除了男女之间以悲剧收场为主题的歌曲以外还有以下的主题为代表歌曲:\n\n夫妻间的幸福---村田英雄“夫妇春秋”、三笠优子“夫妇舟”、川中美幸“二轮草”等等。 \n母亲---菊池章子・二叶百合子“岸壁の母”、金田たつえ“花街の母”等等。 \n家庭之间---鸟羽一郎“兄弟船”、芦屋雁之助“娘よ”、大泉逸郎“孙”等等。 \n人生、特质---村田英雄“人生剧场”、“花と竜”、北岛三郎“山”、“川”、中村美律子“河内おとこ节”等等。 \n流浪---ディック・ミネ“旅姿三人男”、桥幸夫“潮来笠”、冰川きよし“箱根八里の半次郎”等等。 \n侠义---北岛三郎“兄弟仁义”、高仓健“唐狮子牡丹”等等。 \n歌谣浪花---三波春夫“俵星玄蕃”、“纪伊国屋文左卫门”等等。 \n望乡---北岛三郎“帰ろかな”、千昌夫“北国の春”、“望郷酒场”等等。 \n另外，还有不属于以上任何分类的细川贵志“北酒场”。是作曲家根据“酒馆”的样子而创作出来的歌曲。以完全跳脱出一般演歌歌词的情景模式独树一方，获得了日本唱片大奖。\n\n    演歌成为日本大众所接受，成为了日本流行音乐潮流的其中之一。但是，事实上讨厌演歌的人也是不少。比方说，在日本歌谣界大有影响力的歌手“淡谷のり子”就成公开表示她非常讨厌演歌，接着提倡所谓的“演歌扑灭运动”。还有，作曲家“椙山 浩一”在他的自传里写着“演歌架构了日本音乐史上的黑暗时代”。\n\nEnka (演歌) is a popular Japanese music genre. Although considered to resemble traditional music stylistically, modern enka is a relatively recent musical form which arose in the context of such postwar expressions of modern Japanese nonmaterial nationalism as nihonjinron, while adopting a more traditional musical style than Japanese prewar popular ryūkōka music in the vocalism.\n\nThe term \"enka\" was first used to refer to political texts set to music which were sung and distributed by opposition activists belonging to the Freedom and People's Rights Movement during the Meiji period (1868–1912) as a means of bypassing government curbs on speeches of political dissent – and in this sense the word is derived from \"enzetsu no uta\" (演説の歌), meaning \"speech song\".\n\nModern enka, as developed in the postwar era, is a form of sentimental ballad music. Some of the first modern enka singers were Hachiro Kasuga, Michiya Mihashi and Hideo Murata. One theory holds that modern enka means \"enjiru uta\" (演じる歌), meaning \"performance song\". The revival of enka in its modern form is said to date from 1969, when Keiko Fuji made her debut.","songs":[{"id":"8Gdb1eec000","name":"紅い花","artist":"dGUZ3fede"},{"id":"8FZL4Wf9f87","name":"北国の春","artist":"ebW048606"},{"id":"8GehwCed9d1","name":"襟裳岬","artist":"b9hRe41c0"},{"id":"bf0sFy82f6c6","name":"涙そうそう","artist":"cOmY4a234"},{"id":"JAKKc7239a1","name":"津軽海峡・冬景色","artist":"b6Iu1b964"},{"id":"U5Akl72a089","name":"ふたたびの","artist":"cwPr26baa"},{"id":"JAZD0Y22c3e","name":"長崎は今日も雨だった","artist":"bjwjb6d18"},{"id":"mQ7ygL86b5f","name":"みちづれ","artist":"LJu7ccb9"},{"id":"8FZKeqea85c","name":"艶姿女花吹雪(あですがたおんなのはなふぶき)","artist":"GEj94794"},{"id":"mQ7Y98545c9","name":"人生いろいろ","artist":"bk6C9fbc7"},{"id":"mQ7X0x8471a","name":"ふたりの大阪","artist":"M1w983a5"},{"id":"bqvgvvh3a69e","name":"雨の永東橋（ヨンドンキョ）","artist":"INQ6440f"}],"albums":[{"id":"fN8U67b63","name":"坂本冬美ベスト 凛","artist":"cOmY4a234"},{"id":"oyNm170e3","name":"森進一全曲集~たずねて小樽~","artist":"b9hRe41c0"},{"id":"fDwW8dbe7","name":"カバーソング・コレクション~ひばり演歌をうたう (2CD) ","artist":"ebW048606"},{"id":"wHeo42449","name":"ベスト・セレクション~葉桜~","artist":"dGUZ3fede"},{"id":"1pzN34583","name":"坂本冬美大全集","artist":"cOmY4a234"},{"id":"knfh1192e","name":"ベスト・セレクション’96","artist":"cwPr26baa"},{"id":"jPy7b1cb9","name":"めぐり逢い～長山洋子全曲集","artist":"GEj94794"},{"id":"gchu4c7c7","name":"大川栄策 CD-BOX","artist":"INQ6440f"},{"id":"jP4vbe9b3","name":"2005年全曲集","artist":"b6Iu1b964"},{"id":"klAPa01e6","name":"都はるみ特選集 邪宗門","artist":"M1w983a5"},{"id":"wODd282a1","name":"ベスト・オブ・ベスト","artist":"KUe6225e"},{"id":"0TLu3199a","name":"Love Songs2~ずっとあなたが好きでした~","artist":"cOmY4a234"}],"artists":[{"id":"hc4ae677","name":"夏川りみ"},{"id":"ebW048606","name":"美空ひばり"},{"id":"b6Iu1b964","name":"石川さゆり"},{"id":"cOmY4a234","name":"坂本冬美"},{"id":"GEj94794","name":"長山洋子"},{"id":"dGUZ3fede","name":"桂銀淑"},{"id":"bfm513a83","name":"氷川きよし"},{"id":"M1w983a5","name":"都はるみ"},{"id":"nbvYea09c","name":"岩佐美咲"},{"id":"LJu7ccb9","name":"牧村三枝子"},{"id":"blbHc71a6","name":"石原詢子"},{"id":"dBrX40bba","name":"水森かおり"}]},{"type":"style","id":"857","name":"日本 | 邦乐 Japanese Traditional Music","description":"邦乐(日语：ほうがく)可说是日本音乐的统称。通常一般都用“洋乐”做为反义词，指西洋音乐以外的日本传统音乐。相对于西洋音乐的七音音阶，近世邦乐是五音音阶，邦乐的节奏多半为两拍、四拍的偶数拍子，几乎没单数的拍子，且歌曲繁多，纯乐器乐曲鲜少。\n\n乐器一般是当作声乐的伴奏乐器为使用，但是仍然与声乐的进行，有着微妙不一致的复杂差异。 此外，因为三味线、琴与尺八等之乐器本身的构造，具有的杂音性要素，也成为邦乐复杂的音色之一而受到广大的喜爱。\n\n自从明治时代开始，洋乐传入日本以后，洋乐即成为了日本音乐的主流，邦乐而因此受到压抑。 可是近年来，邦乐重新受到肯定，爱好邦乐者不断地增加。外国人士的爱好者也越来越多了。\n\n乐器总类\n\n雅乐：举行宫廷仪式之时所演奏的仪式音乐。是古代由中国和朝鲜传入的音乐，可说是日本现存最古老的音乐形式。 \n琵琶乐：战国时代以后，以琵琶伴奏说讲战争故事而兴起的音乐。是边弹边唱的声乐曲。 \n声明：佛教的典礼音乐，属于声乐之一。随着佛教传入日本，对其后的日本音乐产生极大的影响。 \n筝曲：筝曲除了只琴曲之外，尚指琴(古筝)、三味线(三弦琴)与尺八(萧、竖笛)的合奏曲。琴是十三弦的拨弦乐器，在江户时代，因为与三弦琴音乐结合，而发展起来。 \n能乐：集现今“能”剧形式之大成的，是在室町时代初期。能是音乐、舞蹈与戏剧的综合艺术，能的音乐，是由称为“谣”的声乐与称为“杂子”(由笛、鼓、三弦乐器组成)的乐器伴奏所构成的。 \n尺八乐：尺八是镰仓时代虚无僧取代诵经所吹奏的竖笛。由于长度是一尺八寸(约五十五厘米)，故称之为尺八。 \n三弦琴音乐：三弦琴有三条弦，其共鸣箱的鼓面以猫或狗皮制成，是极具代表性的日本乐器。三弦琴在江户时代被运用得极为广泛，不论是歌舞伎、人形净琉璃的剧场音乐，或是各种歌曲音乐的伴奏，即使到了现在，也常常被使用。 \n民谣：各地流传下来的歌谣，以劳动歌为居多。\n\nThe Music of Japan includes a wide array of performers in distinct styles both traditional and modern.

By the '80s, Kuti's style had been well established, and although the massive scale and distinctive personality of his performances attracted few imitators, he was revered as a legend for his musical virtuosity and political activism. Kuti's Afro-Beat was primarily rooted in West African highlife -- a bright, sunny dance music driven by horns and/or guitars -- but synthesized it with African-American musical forms like funk (particularly that of James Brown) and jazz. The results were intensely rhythmic and emphasized large ensembles, extended grooves, and improvised jams instead of song structure (many of Kuti's albums, in fact, featured pieces that were half an hour in length). Although Afro-Beat was at bottom a dance music, Kuti's performances rarely allowed his audiences to get lost in the grooves -- whether through the flashy choreography of his band and backup singers, the demanding length of his songs, or the frequent political tirades aimed at provoking intellectual response. Following Kuti's death in 1997, his son Femi -- who had often taken over as bandleader during Fela's periodic imprisonments -- picked up the Afro-Beat torch and began a full-fledged career of his own, keeping his father's music alive and proving himself a worthy successor.","songs":[{"id":"b4OzWdb293","name":"Money  ","artist":"bih2b837a"},{"id":"xLpM6Db53a6","name":"Amassakoul 'N' Ténéré","artist":"bicpc22f8"},{"id":"xLo7wAcc0ff","name":"A.I.E.

Its rhythms can be traced back to West African Kaiso and the arrival of French planters and their slaves from the French Antilles in the 1600s.\nThe music, which drew upon African and French influences, became the voice of the people, and was characterized by highly rhythmic and harmonic vocals, which was most often sung in a French creole and led by a griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot (originally a similar traveling musician in West Africa) became known as a chantuelle and eventually, calypsonian. As English replaced patois (creole French) as the dominant language, calypso migrated into English, and in so doing it attracted more attention from the government. It allowed the masses to challenge the doings of the unelected Governor and Legislative Council, and the elected town councils of Port of Spain and San Fernando. Calypso continued to play an important role in political expression, and also served to document the history of Trinidad and Tobago.\nWhile most authorities stress the African roots of calypso, in his 1986 book, Calypso from France to Trinidad: 800 Years of History, that veteran calypsonian, The Roaring Lion (Rafael de Leon) asserted that calypso descends from the music of the medieval French troubadours.","songs":[{"id":"b06Tc9bced","name":"Don't Try to Keep up With the Joneses","artist":"dyYo3d170"},{"id":"bqvdaX635ec8","name":"Hill & Gully Ride/Mandevile Rd.","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"8Gd3le195db","name":"Rehab","artist":"Tpec73d2"},{"id":"bqvbLcp39135","name":"Rock of Ages","artist":"yn5xU1dcb3"},{"id":"b1pUnNV40148","name":"Don't Worry Be Happy","artist":"iQb9cebd1"},{"id":"L49S7824a","name":"No Woman, No Cry","artist":"SPhaccf9"},{"id":"b1jQo96810","name":"Bing Crosby","artist":"2IS8ba42"},{"id":"eQu3R3a8f6","name":"Jamaica Farewell","artist":"cAxh4c06d"},{"id":"xNEWipd4e59","name":"大城大事","artist":"dpu83ad37"},{"id":"8GjNDCf7579","name":"老人","artist":"eHOM57f7a"},{"id":"mS1CGW859f2","name":"When A Man Is Poor","artist":"TpAa639b"},{"id":"b1qjlF262f0b","name":"Hot Hot Hot","artist":"3nk58700"}],"albums":[{"id":"Hyb68ecb","name":"Jambo Caribe","artist":"dyYo3d170"},{"id":"fWZA52b3c","name":"Great Expectation","artist":"Tpec73d2"},{"id":"fDIj6354c","name":"Original Cool Jamaican Ska","artist":"yn5xU1dcb3"},{"id":"nYbLf96d5","name":"Ska with Laurel","artist":"yn5xU1dcb3"},{"id":"bp9g116ea","name":"Touching","artist":"dpu83ad37"},{"id":"sSEJ22816","name":"Caribbean Holiday Reggie Paul","artist":"iQb9cebd1"},{"id":"be8Ncd1a5","name":"Discover America","artist":"2IS8ba42"},{"id":"jasYb6001","name":"Calypso","artist":"cAxh4c06d"},{"id":"f7BH86f46","name":"Calypso Blues: The Songs of Na...","artist":"SPhaccf9"},{"id":"eOkM6abc5","name":"An  Evening with Harry Belafon...","artist":"cAxh4c06d"},{"id":"F2K70e06","name":"Stir It Up: The Music of Bob M...","artist":"SPhaccf9"},{"id":"F2v523dd","name":"Ivory & Steel","artist":"SPhaccf9"}],"artists":[{"id":"cAxh4c06d","name":"Harry Belafonte"},{"id":"8wCd8c0c","name":"Raffi"},{"id":"yn5xU1dcb3","name":"Laurel Aitken"},{"id":"SPhaccf9","name":"Monty Alexander"},{"id":"4pn7648c","name":"Nelson"},{"id":"ZPid5392","name":"Gypsy"},{"id":"UNc9b1c4","name":"Andy Narell"},{"id":"32I7d17f","name":"Designer"},{"id":"3oS8f3d4","name":"Mighty Sparrow"},{"id":"dRGX4a9af","name":"Maya Angelou"},{"id":"57x6ba6f","name":"Calypso Rose"},{"id":"bdrtb5ee9","name":"Robert Mitchum"}]},{"type":"style","id":"996","name":"法国 | 香颂 Chanson","description":"香颂(法语：chanson)，意为歌曲，源自于拉丁文cantio，是法国通俗歌曲和情爱流行歌曲的泛称，以甜美浪漫的歌词著称于世。专业的香颂歌手称为chanteur(男)或chanteuse(女)。\n今天在法国，香颂往往指的是像雅克·布雷尔、艾迪特·皮雅芙等著名歌手的作品，区别于其他法国流行音乐，按照法语的节奏，而不是英语的节奏，因此被认为特别“法国”。此外，香颂的歌词也特别讲究韵味和意境。\n\nA chanson is in general any lyric-driven French song, usually polyphonic and secular.

Fado historian and scholar Rui Vieira Nery states that \"the only reliable information on the history of Fado was orally transmitted and goes back to the 1820s and 1830s at best. But even that information was frequently modified within the generational transmission process that made it reach us today.\" In popular belief, fado is a form of music characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor, and infused with a characteristic sentiment of resignation, fatefulness and melancholia (loosely captured by the word saudade, or \"longing\"). However, although the origins are difficult to trace, today fado is regarded, by many, as simply a form of song which can be about anything, but must follow a certain structure. The music is usually linked to the Portuguese word saudade which symbolizes the feeling of loss (a permanent, irreparable loss and its consequent lifelong damage). Famous singers of fado include Amália Rodrigues, Dulce Pontes, Carlos do Carmo, Mariza, Mafalda Arnauth, António Zambujo, Ana Moura and Cristina Branco.\nOn 27 November 2011, Fado was inscribed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.","songs":[{"id":"cSElu23d6b","name":"Miragre","artist":"ZxY10443"},{"id":"b1pOMqf40b3a","name":"Cancao Do Mar","artist":"dg0038609"},{"id":"mQ9bs756446","name":"Los Hermanos (The Brothers)","artist":"bobR9a8f6"},{"id":"b9V96d7036","name":"Nem As Paredes Confesso","artist":"3px79cc8"},{"id":"mQ4n7v91c8c","name":"Dulce Caravela","artist":"bhmJaf96e"},{"id":"UZ4H719c0","name":"Alfonsina y el Mar","artist":"bfxPb6696"},{"id":"cqeYcf9267","name":"Ó Gente da Minha Terra","artist":"be8Ye099c"},{"id":"8FZExq2432f","name":"Sete Rosas","artist":"b68Xe6a3c"},{"id":"bCkCYox44759","name":"Rosa Negra","artist":"bolWca4a9"},{"id":"8GcRideb6fa","name":"Casa (Tentei Fugir Da Mancha Mais Escura)","artist":"bAZVe1ca5"},{"id":"bf07boc33638","name":"Rama","artist":"b6GXCUa9efb"},{"id":"mQ3Mn62009a","name":"Aquela Janela Virada P'ro Mar","artist":"ecLO4567c"}],"albums":[{"id":"jtnBcc293","name":"Ainda","artist":"ZxY10443"},{"id":"cfJO22e0e","name":"Art Os Amália, Vol. 1","artist":"3px79cc8"},{"id":"krtNc027e","name":"Flor Nocturna","artist":"bobR9a8f6"},{"id":"omAh17bdb","name":"Momentos ","artist":"dg0038609"},{"id":"0Ekd3495c","name":"Todo ou Nada","artist":"bhmJaf96e"},{"id":"jFXpbbcee","name":"Fado em Mim","artist":"be8Ye099c"},{"id":"jKcIb3a38","name":"Ulisses","artist":"bfxPb6696"},{"id":"fRaC66802","name":"Os Fados Do Fado","artist":"bhmJaf96e"},{"id":"ghkx57cc2","name":"Fado Português","artist":"3px79cc8"},{"id":"f7TN78977","name":"Kronos","artist":"bfxPb6696"},{"id":"f3Op5b43c","name":"Transparente","artist":"be8Ye099c"},{"id":"CGoZ45ba2","name":"Faluas Do Tejo","artist":"ZxY10443"}],"artists":[{"id":"bvRke8df1","name":"Cesária Évora"},{"id":"3px79cc8","name":"Amália Rodrigues"},{"id":"ZxY10443","name":"Madredeus"},{"id":"baEXad9d7","name":"Teresa Salgueiro"},{"id":"be8Ye099c","name":"Mariza"},{"id":"dg0038609","name":"Dulce Pontes"},{"id":"bfxPb6696","name":"Cristina Branco"},{"id":"VQte02d6","name":"Misia"},{"id":"bhmJaf96e","name":"Katia Guerreiro"},{"id":"bobR9a8f6","name":"Marta Topferova"},{"id":"bAZVe1ca5","name":"Camané"},{"id":"EP37e30f","name":"Deolinda"}]},{"type":"style","id":"635","name":"西班牙 | 弗拉门戈 Flamenco","description":"弗拉门戈（Flamenco），是一种源于西班牙南部安达卢西亚地区的艺术形式，包括歌曲、音乐和舞蹈。\n\n弗拉门戈的形成深受安达卢西亚地区的摩尔人和犹太人的影响，还吸收了大量罗姆人（吉普赛人）的艺术元素。当代著名的弗拉门戈舞蹈家大多是罗姆人。由于西班牙政府以此推动旅游业，弗拉门戈舞已经成了西班牙舞蹈甚至西班牙文化的代表。\n\n弗拉门戈音乐有50种，每种有自己的节奏模式。弗拉门戈舞蹈是一种即兴舞蹈，没有固定的动作，全靠舞者和演唱、伴奏的人以及观众之间的情绪互动。\n\nFlamenco (Spanish pronunciation: [flaˈmeŋko]) is a form of Spanish folk music and dance from the region of Andalusia in southern Spain.

Although Gregorian chant supplanted or marginalized the other indigenous plainchant traditions of the Christian West to become the official music of the Christian liturgy, Ambrosian chant still continues in use in Milan, and there are musicologists exploring both that and the Mozarabic chant of Christian Spain. Although Gregorian chant is no longer obligatory, the Roman Catholic Church still officially considers it the music most suitable for worship. During the 20th century, Gregorian chant underwent a musicological and popular resurgence.","songs":[{"id":"OJ4Oaf605","name":"The Mass","artist":"bwlx19c9f"},{"id":"cqNg4e3b40","name":"Moment Of Peace","artist":"WnUa03fb"},{"id":"cqNlRf761d","name":"Can You Feel The Love Tonight","artist":"WnUa03fb"},{"id":"mQ9v0C5aaf2","name":"Spiritus domini - Introit (Modo VIII)","artist":"bEAaef1be"},{"id":"xLtCejcb2ad","name":"Vexilla regis (hymnus)","artist":"bn0Ze1245"},{"id":"xL1nHe9e9db","name":"Ave Maria","artist":"dbKqotcbbcb"},{"id":"mQJpnq4f363","name":"Bach - Chorale BWV 605","artist":"nm79Ot78d76"},{"id":"8GqUdF1b804","name":"Improperia: Popule meus, quid feci tibi?","artist":"9cynvVf770d"},{"id":"xL3OQUc7251","name":"Alleluia, dulce carmen (Farewell to the Alleluia before Lent) (Voice)","artist":"bC7fsnM4b275"},{"id":"mQJ1wR620a9","name":"Gregorian Chant: Laudes Solemnes - 2.

In some instances Jewish music is of a religious nature, spiritual songs and refrains are common in Jewish Services throughout the world, while other times, it is of a secular nature. The rhythm and sound of Jewish music varies greatly depending on the origins of the Jewish composer and the time period in which the piece was composed.\n\nAs Velvel Pasternak writes, \"The importance of music in the life of the Jewish people is found almost at the beginning of Genesis... [musicians are] mentioned among the three fundamental professions.... Music was viewed as a necessity in everyday life, as a beautifying and enriching complement of human existence.\"","songs":[{"id":"mQ3SrK10be1","name":"One Day","artist":"ZfXaddf5"},{"id":"M3Ks6ec64","name":"(Do The) Latke Flip-Flop","artist":"Tpze1404"},{"id":"mQ51X5915bc","name":"Di Golden Pave","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"xLpymdbfb3f","name":"Una Noche Mas","artist":"dn8n3b85a"},{"id":"ScSj53636","name":"Refugee","artist":"bbmvd549c"},{"id":"ciaaGef1ea","name":"Shaday","artist":"btpP1d44f"},{"id":"xLquSwbfa69","name":"Saints and Dates","artist":"ISH636e5"},{"id":"bBae511003","name":"Grooved Shoulders","artist":"9Ym4db7b"},{"id":"SXIX4fc08","name":"A Night in Wyoming","artist":"b2DKef43e"},{"id":"O3Rb700cb","name":"La Cumparsita","artist":"3nV966a4"},{"id":"cTfYm3bd9b","name":"Burnt by the Sun","artist":"9Yw539f7"},{"id":"b2RZpa6a87","name":"Dana Dana (Dona Dona)","artist":"clSs26c51"}],"albums":[{"id":"fDIV81dc5","name":"Light","artist":"ZfXaddf5"},{"id":"0ewu31e60","name":"Youth","artist":"ZfXaddf5"},{"id":"bpvSd7f4b","name":"Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous H...","artist":"Tpze1404"},{"id":"0Fms2fdc8","name":"Mano Suave","artist":"dn8n3b85a"},{"id":"fpzf7da10","name":"Laughter Through Tears","artist":"bbmvd549c"},{"id":"Pj581791","name":"Shaday","artist":"btpP1d44f"},{"id":"n3Vpfdb8e","name":"No Place to Be","artist":"ZfXaddf5"},{"id":"svTz1e1f7","name":"Dance of the Idiots","artist":"ISH636e5"},{"id":"ffDh8c90c","name":"Shake Off the Dust...

Played by professional musicians called klezmorim, the genre originally consisted largely of dance tunes and instrumental display pieces for weddings and other celebrations. In the United States the genre evolved considerably as Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, who arrived between 1880 and 1924, met and assimilated American jazz. During the initial years after the klezmer revival of the 1970s, this was what most people knew as klezmer, although in the current century musicians have begun paying more attention to the \"original\" pre-jazz traditions as revivalists including Josh Horowitz, Yale Strom, and Bob Cohen have spent years doing field research in Eastern/Central Europe. Additionally, late immigrants from the Soviet Union such as German Goldenshtayn brought their surviving repertoires to the United States and Israel in the 1980s.\n\nCompared to most other European folk music styles, little is known about the history of klezmer music, and much of what is said about it must be seen as conjecture. Starting in 2008, \"The Other Europeans\" project, funded by several EU cultural institutions, spent a year doing intensive field research in Moldavia under the leadership of Alan Bern and scholar Zev Feldman. They wanted to explore klezmer and lautari roots, and fuse the music of the two \"other European\" groups. The resulting band now performs internationally. As with this ensemble, groups like Di Naye Kapelye and Yale Strom & Hot Pstromi have incorporated Rom musicians and elements since their inceptions.","songs":[{"id":"M3Ks6ec64","name":"(Do The) Latke Flip-Flop","artist":"Tpze1404"},{"id":"ScSj53636","name":"Refugee","artist":"bbmvd549c"},{"id":"bf0qyZj34a89","name":"Yor Uzga  (Uzbekistan)","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"xLquSwbfa69","name":"Saints and Dates","artist":"ISH636e5"},{"id":"bBae511003","name":"Grooved Shoulders","artist":"9Ym4db7b"},{"id":"O3Rb700cb","name":"La Cumparsita","artist":"3nV966a4"},{"id":"cTfYm3bd9b","name":"Burnt by the Sun","artist":"9Yw539f7"},{"id":"f5eIg3faa2","name":"Eyli Ato","artist":"VD6c1f1c"},{"id":"gmjEz466f7","name":"Yor Nokh Mayn Khasene [A Year After My Wedding]","artist":"3o67ef42"},{"id":"gm84x49235","name":"Evreisky Tanz","artist":"cBTs2e978"},{"id":"b1tDgb1fcc","name":"Maggid","artist":"VDBb76e8"},{"id":"b9Ex4da685","name":"Reb Itzik's Nign","artist":"DS64d1dc"}],"albums":[{"id":"bpvSd7f4b","name":"Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous H...","artist":"Tpze1404"},{"id":"fpzf7da10","name":"Laughter Through Tears","artist":"bbmvd549c"},{"id":"svTz1e1f7","name":"Dance of the Idiots","artist":"ISH636e5"},{"id":"f8i56c59f","name":"Dancing on the Volcano","artist":"9Ym4db7b"},{"id":"bpvR999f5","name":"Wonder Wheel","artist":"Tpze1404"},{"id":"bpiZbb104","name":"Clarinetango","artist":"3nV966a4"},{"id":"zGua32342","name":"Nigunim","artist":"VD6c1f1c"},{"id":"Dadr48ae5","name":"Perlman Plays Klezmer","artist":"DS64d1dc"},{"id":"Pve77568","name":"Old World Beat","artist":"3o67ef42"},{"id":"jyJOc8eb3","name":"Search for the Golden Dreydl","artist":"b0Bz19440"},{"id":"jwhIbc9ce","name":"Poison Sweet Madeira","artist":"9Yw539f7"},{"id":"bpiVa8980","name":"World Network Vol. 19: Israel ...","artist":"3nV966a4"}],"artists":[{"id":"3nV966a4","name":"Giora Feidman"},{"id":"9Ym4db7b","name":"Guy Klucevsek"},{"id":"VD6c1f1c","name":"Frank London"},{"id":"ISH636e5","name":"Koby Israelite"},{"id":"b0Bz19440","name":"Naftule's Dream"},{"id":"3o67ef42","name":"Klezmer Conservatory Band"},{"id":"Tpze1404","name":"The Klezmatics"},{"id":"VPCd946d","name":"Davka"},{"id":"VDBb76e8","name":"Andy Statman"},{"id":"bb1Naaa70","name":"Bar Kokhba"},{"id":"3n04d7a9","name":"Naftule Brandwein"},{"id":"cHPN33f64","name":"The Cracow Klezmer Band"}]},{"type":"style","id":"923","name":"巴西 | 全域音乐 MPB","description":"MPB (巴西全域音乐；音读作[emi-be-'be])，是Musica Popular Brasileira (即英文的Brazilian Popular Music)的缩写，但其定义并非如此“简单”，也不能直接照字面来翻译，且亦不能和一般所谓的pop乐及巴西本土的pop乐混为一谈。因为，所谓的MPB (巴西全域音乐)，也就是对于被归类为MPB的巴西musicians，乃系代表着他们的音乐是包罗万象而各自独树一帜的。其创作唱奏音乐的素材曲风是没有地域背景或乐风范畴的局限而能运用自如，且主要在于巴西所有的音乐风格和其他乐风皆是他们用作诠释创作的题材而从中加以发挥创新。 \n所以，MPB是一种象征，是一种领域，是一种代表，是一种称号；举凡是MPB的musicians，就像是“十项全能”的音乐健将，或者可说其是具备了“十八般武艺”。换言之，他们即是代表着拥有丰富乐思而唱作俱佳的“全能musicians”。也因而，MPB所引申而意指的则是所谓“巴西全域音乐”的领域总称。 \n巴西丰富的人文和地理背景，使其拥有着数十种的乐风如bossa nova、samba-cancao、choro、modinha等等。而在MPB出现前，巴西乐手唱奏的音乐，系有其固守的范畴类别，也就是依一个或数个州划分的区域(region)如东南、东北、中西部等，以及视该州或区域源创或盛行那些乐风，还有乐手生长于哪一州或属哪一区域，而自然形成壁垒分明的乐派风格，即如samba的乐者不会去唱奏forro，或是bumba-meu-boi的乐者不会去唱奏choro；而MPB的出现，却打破了巴西传统音乐固守疆域的藩篱。虽然，MPB亦是巴西音乐的其中一范畴类别，但其所代表象征的，系指隶属于MPB的乐者，其所创作及唱奏的音乐内涵遍及涉猎了巴西本土的各式乐风以及包含国际其他音乐素材。 \nMPB的诞生，除了与1964年3月31日的巴西政坛之变化而造成由军人执政 (至1985年始恢复平民总统)，其对于文字言论的箝制，使得像乐手、记者、作家等，皆有因歌词或文章有政治抗议成分的而相继被捕入狱或暂自我放逐他国一段时日外，主要是自1965年后陆续崛起的巴西乐坛菁英，无论之前是否已有灌录唱片或已具备知名度，皆还是为了一展其音乐才华实力而积极参加由巴西的几家电视媒体或唱片界所举办或赞助的一连串竞争激烈的音乐比赛，并从其中脱颖而出。而这些比赛的参赛过程大致均须经由音乐家、乐评主笔和唱片界人士所组成之评审来初审筛选参赛者能否入围参赛，到获得参赛资格，再到评审列席和现场观众聚集的正式比赛，并透过现场转播而呈现于电视萤光幕前，可以说能够在比赛中夺得冠军或名列前茅的参赛者均是具备有过人实力，以致是实至名归而无法有半点侥幸的。 \n所以，像是自1965年第一届的“Festival da Musica Popular Brasileira巴西全域音乐大赏”中，以一首由Edu Lobo (艾都．娄伯)作曲、Vinicius de Moraes (费尼希邬斯．迪摩赖斯)作词的\"Arrastao\"(撒网)夺得冠军的Elis Regina (艾莉丝．海吉娜)。到翌年第二届时，Chico Buarque (席古．布瓦奇)与Nara Leao (娜拉．黎翁)合作对唱由Chico Buarque自行创作的\"A Banda\" (乐团)，以及与Jair Rodrigues (贾伊．侯迪里给斯)演唱Geraldo Vandre (杰劳度．法得雷)和Theo de Barros (得欧．迪巴何斯)所创作的\"Disparada\"(全速)而同时并列为第一。再到第三届时，由Edu Lobo唱奏他与Capinam (噶毕拿)所创作的\"Ponteio\"(乱弹一把)而夺得冠军，另亚军则由Gilberto Gil (吉贝度．吉尔)和Os Mutantes (突变体乐团)演唱Gilberto Gil自行创作的\"Domingo no Parque\"(星期天在公园)获得，而Caetano Veloso (盖登弩．斐娄叟)与来自阿根廷的乐团Os Beat Boys (节奏男孩)所合唱的个人创作\"Alegria, Alegria\"(兴高采烈)则获得该届的第四名；而由Gilberto Gil、Caetano Veloso、Gal Costa (高儿．歌丝达)、Os Mutants、Nara Leao、Tom Ze (东．泽)等发动的Tropicalia (热潮乐流)之巴西全域音乐movement即从此时展开，虽然至1969年时因军政府的强势干预而嘎然而止，但MPB已是屹立不摇。 \n再者，由于这些身经百战而过关斩将且脱颖而出的参赛者均有自成一格的独特风格，并在创作和诠译唱奏上予人不落俗套且擅于推陈出新的气势格局。因而，在他们相继成为巴西乐坛的全能菁英时，也同时对巴西音乐瞬间掀起了巨大的风潮并建立起所向披靡而突破传统藩篱的全能领域。况且，由于这些建立起巴西音乐全能领域的元老菁英皆从巴西各大音乐竞赛脱颖而来，尤其是从1965年所展开的“Festival de Musica Popular Brasileira”在率先发掘乐坛新秀的同时，也带动了其他的音乐大赏的蓬勃举办而加入发掘乐坛菁英的行列，因而，MPB就这么地被用来象征代表巴西全能musicians之所谓“巴西全域音乐”之领域总称。\n\n英文简介\n\nMúsica Popular Brasileira (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈmuzikɐ popuˈlaʁ bɾaziˈlejɾɐ], Brazilian Pop Music) or MPB is a trend in post-Bossa Nova urban popular music. It is not a distinct genre but rather a combination of original songwriting and updated versions of traditional Brazilian urban music styles like samba and samba-canção with contemporary influences, like folk, rock, pop and jazz.\nMPB is a contemporary trend that has produced many renowned Brazilian artists, like Jorge Ben, Novos Baianos and Chico Buarque, whose individual styles generate trends within the genre. The term can mean either any kind of music with Brazilian origins or a voice and guitar style that arose in the late 1960s. MPB can also be influenced by newer, non-traditional musical trends.","songs":[{"id":"cpcype5839","name":"O Que Restou Do Nosso Amo (Que Reste-T-Il de Nos Amours)","artist":"CROb2e1e"},{"id":"SzFT82a53","name":"Jardim","artist":"bbLQb9c3f"},{"id":"b2Uly16150","name":"Aquela","artist":"5Ix5cac8"},{"id":"eQIO238131","name":"Tens (Calmaria)","artist":"5Iva2e25"},{"id":"ToDC81704","name":"Quando a Chuva Passar","artist":"bdfhc44c3"},{"id":"eqkmm2dbf1","name":"Primavera","artist":"BGS73bc3"},{"id":"co5IXf707f","name":"Menininha Do Portão","artist":"CcD8d1ec"},{"id":"b4pDFb7c74","name":"Dois Pra lá, Dois Pra Cá","artist":"buRKedcc9"},{"id":"mQHkiW6e04e","name":"Love Train","artist":"bnDj100fb"},{"id":"mQKZ7f80473","name":"Metade (Ao Vivo)","artist":"bjDUa01c9"},{"id":"8Gr6vte4810","name":"Somewhere Else","artist":"VHR9de32"},{"id":"b5F9cb20eb","name":"Hey","artist":"d3WU41a28"}],"albums":[{"id":"j8UHaf929","name":"Juventude/Slow Motion Bossa No...","artist":"CROb2e1e"},{"id":"j4eMb4f48","name":"Rosa","artist":"bbLQb9c3f"},{"id":"fwLH8117f","name":"Natural","artist":"CROb2e1e"},{"id":"yhTkhEde148","name":"e中人 极度怀旧","artist":"yivmnGc1d84"},{"id":"eFSw66e71","name":"Infinito Particular","artist":"5Ix5cac8"},{"id":"nelffb8ed","name":"Modo Livre","artist":"5Iva2e25"},{"id":"nLTCf5d42","name":"Perfil","artist":"bdfhc44c3"},{"id":"nGnCf8aac","name":"Rosa Passos Canta Antonio Carl...","artist":"bbLQb9c3f"},{"id":"rSea1f3ff","name":"Berimbaum","artist":"BGS73bc3"},{"id":"juMsc3e77","name":"The Life Aquatic Studio Sessio...","artist":"ZGv99509"},{"id":"iQB6a7af2","name":"Baiana da Gema","artist":"VOkdf412"},{"id":"0qES4c3ba","name":"Amorosa","artist":"bbLQb9c3f"}],"artists":[{"id":"eDnY60acf","name":"Paula Fernandes"},{"id":"CROb2e1e","name":"Celso Fonseca"},{"id":"bon0d9ffe","name":"Nana Caymmi"},{"id":"ZGv99509","name":"Seu Jorge"},{"id":"bQln24674","name":"Jane Duboc"},{"id":"CcD8d1ec","name":"Maria Rita"},{"id":"KU962270","name":"Patrícia Marx"},{"id":"du5Y3b2dc","name":"Wanessa Camargo"},{"id":"JG18bc2a","name":"António Chaínho"},{"id":"b2SAf2334","name":"CéU"},{"id":"NoEb6a9b","name":"Arthur Verocai"},{"id":"XQRa47e7","name":"Cláudia Leitte"}]},{"type":"style","id":"210","name":"多米尼加 | 默朗格 Merengue","description":"默朗格舞曲(Merengue)多米尼加一种舞曲,据说是非洲和西班牙歌曲混合延伸而来,传说有可能是早期黑奴多遭到地主压榨劳力,为了防止奴隶逃走,往往将两个人的脚用脚镣铐在一起,以便利采收甘蔗,因此搭配鼓声,奴隶们随着鼓声,让两个人拖着脚步一起采收甘蔗,有一点像是,二人三脚的动作。不过默朗格舞曲真正来源已不可考。\n    1920年代多米尼加人&Ntilde;ico Lora正式把此舞曲定位,多国独裁者楚希略于1930年代把默朗格舞曲风格推广到全国各地,由于其舞曲轻快,很快的就传遍各地。演奏默朗格舞曲的乐器主要有沙鼓、小喇叭、手风琴和多国特有的Güira(铁刷)。1980年代和1990年代,外流的多米尼加移民把默朗格舞曲传到国外,而逐渐的流行到美国东岸各大城市间。\n\n\nMerengue is a type of music and dance originating in the Dominican Republic which has become one of the most popular genres throughout Latin America. The etymology of its name is much disputed. It may derive from the French dessert meringue, but it is also likely to be related to similar West African words related to dance and music.\nMerengue was first mentioned around the middle of the 1800s. In the Dominican Republic it was promoted by Rafael Trujillo, the dictator from the 1930 to 1961, who turned it into the country's national music and dance style.

It is a musical tradition that stretches back to more than 700 years.\nOriginally performed mainly at Sufi shrines or dargahs throughout South Asia, it has also gained mainstream popularity. Qawwali music received international exposure through the work of the late Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, largely due to several releases on the Real World label, followed by live appearances at WOMAD festivals. Other famous Qawwali singers include Pakistan's Sabri Brothers, Bahauddin Qutbuddin and Aziz Mian.\n\nOrigins\nThe roots of Qawwali can be traced back to 8th century Persia (today's Iran and Afghanistan). During the first major migration from Persia, in the 11th century, the musical tradition of Sema migrated to South Asia, Turkey and Uzbekistan. Amir Khusro Dehelvi of the Chisti order of Sufis is credited with fusing the Persian and Indian musical traditions to create Qawwali as we know it today in the late 13th century in India. The word Sama is often still used in Central Asia and Turkey to refer to forms very similar to Qawwali, and in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the formal name used for a session of Qawwali is Mehfil-e-Sama.\nQaul (Arabic: قَوْل) is an \"utterance (of the prophet)\", Qawwāl is someone who often repeats (sings) a Qaul, Qawwāli is what a Qawwāl sings.","songs":[{"id":"K4kR8cd87","name":"Raga I","artist":"bsTBe607c"},{"id":"8FZW2Xe5f2f","name":"Day By Day","artist":"XVhc2571"},{"id":"MyAk7e87c","name":"My Heart, My Life","artist":"Tpvb96d0"},{"id":"L1yf90b56","name":"Allah Ho Ya Rehman (God Is Great and Merciful)","artist":"bvDxf96eb"},{"id":"cgUsre9ecd","name":"Allah-Hoo, Allah-Hoo","artist":"btrqe70bb"},{"id":"b1pOiZl42f2a","name":"Bethe Bethe Kese Kese","artist":"biLxb9f96"},{"id":"b0Xqje17be","name":"The Karma Shade of Dub","artist":"dPwH45d8e"},{"id":"ePmlW36680","name":"Ali the Holy Prophet (Ha Peer Hamara Ali Ali)","artist":"5B6861da"},{"id":"cmXvNf0450","name":"Wheel of Heaven","artist":"ZJv1420f"},{"id":"xL6265d90e1","name":"Shaam Se Aankh Mein Nami Si Hai (From \"Marasim\")","artist":"eFPj83145"},{"id":"mQFiLy6025c","name":"Aaj Jane Ki Zid Na Karo","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"8HLv0Ce6d50","name":"Mere Baap Ka Kya Jaata Hai","artist":"9cyowcfcd10"}],"albums":[{"id":"jQwwc3511","name":"East of Eden","artist":"XVhc2571"},{"id":"PsL6611d","name":"Night Song","artist":"Tpvb96d0"},{"id":"b7sYfd26f","name":"Ragas and Sagas","artist":"bsTBe607c"},{"id":"Ps484852","name":"Mustt Mustt","artist":"Tpvb96d0"},{"id":"3SDC3a9a2","name":"Sacrifice to Love","artist":"bvDxf96eb"},{"id":"Dum4759cd","name":"Dub Qawwali","artist":"biLxb9f96"},{"id":"bFJFe1e89","name":"Dub of Asia","artist":"dPwH45d8e"},{"id":"bptxbdd2b","name":"Shahen-Shah","artist":"Tpvb96d0"},{"id":"bFJ1e8793","name":"Qawwali: Sufi Music from Pakis...","artist":"btrqe70bb"},{"id":"bFvjf2796","name":"Sufi Qawwalis","artist":"Tpvb96d0"},{"id":"jYH5dc986","name":"The Rough Guide to Nusrat Fate...","artist":"Tpvb96d0"},{"id":"iTUDc4d49","name":"Lost in Qawwali, Vol. 1","artist":"5B6861da"}],"artists":[{"id":"Tpvb96d0","name":"Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan"},{"id":"btrqe70bb","name":"The Sabri Brothers"},{"id":"biLxb9f96","name":"Gaudi"},{"id":"bmyrdeda1","name":"Abida Parveen"},{"id":"bvDxf96eb","name":"Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali Group"},{"id":"be2xc2cf5","name":"Aziz Mian"},{"id":"bCzpe4059","name":"Faiz Ali Faiz"},{"id":"5B6861da","name":"Badar Ali Khan"},{"id":"ZJv1420f","name":"Temple of Sound"},{"id":"Dnn6b357","name":"David Borden"},{"id":"5B74eeb9","name":"Jafar Husayn Khan"},{"id":"bnl6c85f9","name":"Fareed Ayaz"}]},{"type":"style","id":"598","name":"印度 | 拉格 Raga","description":"“拉格”(Raga,梵语的\"raga\",意热情。)被称为印度古典音乐的灵魂,也是印度古典音乐的基本调(Tune),也可说是旋律的种子。它是一种旋律的框架。它有很多种,每种拉格都有自己特有的音阶,音程以及旋律片断,并表达某种特定的味(Rasa),但拉格本身只是一种框架,它要靠音乐家的即兴表演加以丰富、完善。\n拉格原意为色彩(Color)或热情(Passion),因此拉格企图藉特定音符组合的旋律,来引领聆听者的情绪和感情,由五个到七个的音符所组成的基本旋律,做自由的变化。这种先人所制定的旋律型(Raga) 北印度有3百种,但很多也失传了,有谱可循的拉格有80余种,如今常用的约60余种。在传统习惯上,不论是演唱或演奏,要点选的拉格是完全依据时间、季节、情绪来决定的,早晨、中午、晚上或春夏秋冬,悲伤、喜悦或敬神等拉格是不容混淆的。拉格不只是固定的旋律型,由于加上时间、加上更细致等抽象的情境情绪的诉求和即兴的技巧、演奏长短、速度的掌控,因此表演者也是创作者,具有作曲家的能力,才算得上是胜任称职的印度的音乐家。\n\nA raga (literally \"colour, hue\" but also \"beauty, melody\"; also spelled raag, raaga, ragam; pronounced rāga, rāg or rāgam) is one of the melodic modes used in Indian classical music.\nA raga uses a series of five or more musical notes upon which a melody is constructed.

When Prohibition made it illegal to sell alcohol in the United States, the American mob journeyed south to Cuba to set up smuggling operations and tourist outlets like nightclubs, hotels and casinos. Supported by General Machada, \"The President of a Thousand Murders,\" the area around Havana became home to world-famous clubs like the Tropicana and became a major destination for wealthy Americans seeking to escape the austere pallor that had descended back home. The resulting influx of visitors from the U.S. helped create fervent cravings for Cuban music in the States when the tourists returned home with heads full of vibrant Latin sounds. The New York nightclubs and Hollywood movie producers who capitalized on this trend, however were scared away by the dark-skinned players and complex rhythms of the authentic son and rumba bands from the island, and instead promoted a kind of big-band hybrid which was introduced by musicians like Los Angeles-based Xavier Cugat. This music, while sharing a nearly identical name with rumba, had little in common with the music that had originated in the black neighborhoods of Havana and other cities. The name rhumba was effective in conjuring up exotic and exuberant images to market to American audiences, even though authentic rumba was also going through changes at this time as a new generation of musicians adopted western instruments like the piano and upright bass in an effort to sound less folky and ethnic. The name was broadly applied, with many of rhumba's original hits, like Don Azpiazu's arrangement of Moises Simón's \"El Manciero\" actually being son songs. The rhythms of folk music provided rhumba a jumping-off point, but Cugat's pan-Latin influences and the swing bands of New York helped give it a rapidly evolving sound that nearly immediately became a worldwide craze. Havana became known as a cultural center, but many of the bands there knew where the money was coming from and gave themselves English names like Happy Happy and Swing Havana to increase their commercial appeal. Both Miami and New York became centers of the rhumba craze — with New York rhumba taking cues from big bands and bandleaders in Miami like Desi Arnaz importing new elements like conga drums and carneval-style line dances (the traditional rumba dances were thought to be too hard for non-Cubans to learn) to create dance music that was even more infectious and uncomplicated than rhumba had been. By the late '40s, most rhumba music had picked up the conga drums and line dances of the Miami style and began to be known as \"conga\" instead. However, until the ubiquitous term, \"salsa\" began to be applied to nearly all big-band Latin music in the '70s, the term rhumba was used generically to identify nearly all music from Cuba. — Stacia Proefrock","songs":[{"id":"bAC58cbc4c","name":"The Ketchup Song (Hey Hah)","artist":"cvgq456e5"},{"id":"b9VRh14359","name":"La Sitiera","artist":"beuCab7d4"},{"id":"ciRxLe35f3","name":"Always in My Heart","artist":"buGSfb836"},{"id":"8GhFrme89b9","name":"Handels Chaconne, Teil I","artist":"emcr77e79"},{"id":"ch4rwf8e2c","name":"Bin Bin","artist":"VFAda428"},{"id":"RGqd574ac","name":"Tanta Tinta Tonta","artist":"b0GM17124"},{"id":"xL1EEvd7f0c","name":"Todavia Me Queda Voz","artist":"URka5e8e"},{"id":"Kz2X6e230","name":"Carnavalito","artist":"2OD823bf"},{"id":"gk7oF4693f","name":"Karola (Carol)","artist":"TpZce67f"},{"id":"VzSA9083b","name":"La Hora","artist":"dhdI5fc81"},{"id":"8GmkJ1ea3b9","name":"Sidewalks of San Francisco","artist":"XHzaef88"},{"id":"b9aeob7415","name":"Dame Cariño","artist":"bSMA2523c"}],"albums":[{"id":"f6sj59c58","name":"Hijas del Tomate","artist":"cvgq456e5"},{"id":"f2Ge4f26e","name":"Buena Vista Social Club Presen...","artist":"beuCab7d4"},{"id":"jEPyaa8a6","name":"Gracias","artist":"beuCab7d4"},{"id":"jEPrb2fb6","name":"Flor de Amor","artist":"beuCab7d4"},{"id":"jdCed4e2b","name":"The Latin Soul of Xavier Cugat","artist":"buGSfb836"},{"id":"eR2o60cbc","name":"Cugi's Cocktails","artist":"buGSfb836"},{"id":"iTjH14211","name":"Rumba Baby Rumba","artist":"VFAda428"},{"id":"gQPGJc2dd6a","name":"Ay, Candela","artist":"URka5e8e"},{"id":"jdCg9a68a","name":"Twist with Cugat","artist":"buGSfb836"},{"id":"0lJu33f30","name":"La Calle Es Tuya?","artist":"b0GM17124"},{"id":"jI1nc81af","name":"Un Blodymary","artist":"cvgq456e5"},{"id":"cLKe34056","name":"Fenix","artist":"2OD823bf"}],"artists":[{"id":"4OU93c2c","name":"Rubén González"},{"id":"beuCab7d4","name":"Omara Portuondo"},{"id":"buGSfb836","name":"Xavier Cugat"},{"id":"cvgq456e5","name":"Las Ketchup"},{"id":"7MV89e23","name":"Ojos de Brujo"},{"id":"Tnece606","name":"Professor Longhair"},{"id":"VFAda428","name":"Bio Ritmo"},{"id":"b0GM17124","name":"Estopa"},{"id":"UPV9ae9e","name":"Sabu Martinez"},{"id":"buRU17ed5","name":"Beny Moré"},{"id":"bSMA2523c","name":"El Arrebato"},{"id":"TpZce67f","name":"Remmy Ongala"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3174","name":"巴西 | 桑巴 Samba","description":"桑巴(葡萄牙语：Samba)，是源于巴西巴伊亚的一种舞蹈和音乐类型。音乐主要是由弦乐、打击乐和歌手来共同完成，而舞者则负责舞蹈的部分。桑巴是巴西最具代表性的国家象征之一。桑巴最早根源于非洲土著带有宗教仪式性的舞蹈，通过被贩卖到巴西的黑人奴隶带到巴西，再遇流传至当地的其他文化混合，渐渐反演成今日的桑巴。桑巴现已被世界公认为巴西和巴西狂欢节的象征。桑巴被认为是最大众化的巴西文化表达形式之一，已经变成巴西国家认同的符号。巴伊亚的圆圈桑巴舞(一种里约热内卢的桑巴)在2005年被联合国教科文组织列入人类非物质文化遗产代表作名录。\n桑巴原是非洲土著舞蹈，原是一种带有宗教仪式性的舞蹈。在16至18世纪间，葡萄牙人由非洲如安哥拉、刚果等地引进了大量黑奴至殖民地巴西，以取代巴西人与原住民不愿做的工作，而黑奴也将他们的舞蹈带入巴西。\n三十年代桑巴舞传入美国，由于它趣味性强，生动活泼。后来经过美国舞蹈专家们的提练和加工，在基本训练、舞步规范及编排上不断研究与改进，把它纳为拉丁舞系列的五大舞种之一，并正式定为国际标准舞的比赛项目。每逢节日，巴西城镇盛行狂欢，人们会跳起豪放而又带点即兴发挥的桑巴舞蹈，因为它那节奏活泼，一重一轻，很快便流传到欧美各大城市。\n\n桑巴风格：\n节拍：2/4 节奏： 每小节有2拍，第二拍为重拍。 速度：每分52-54小节。 风格：音乐欢欣，舞态生动，步伐摇曳绵密。\n\n英文简介\nSamba (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈsɐ̃bɐ]) is a Brazilian dance and musical genre originating in Bahia, Brazil, and with its roots in Rio de Janeiro and Africa via the West African slave trade and African religious traditions. It is recognized around the world as a symbol of Brazil and the Brazilian Carnival. Considered one of the most popular Brazilian cultural expressions, samba has become an icon of Brazilian national identity.The Bahian Samba de Roda (dance circle), which became a UNESCO Heritage of Humanity in 2005, is the main root of the samba carioca, the samba that is played and danced in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe modern samba that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century is predominately in a 2/4 tempo varied with the conscious use of a sung chorus to a batucada rhythm, with various stanzas of declaratory verses. Traditionally, the samba is played by strings (cavaquinho and various types of guitar) and various percussion instruments such as tamborim. Influenced by American orchestras in vogue since the Second World War and the cultural impact of US music post-war, samba began to use trombones, trumpets, choros, flutes, and clarinets.\n\nIn addition to distinct rhythms and bar, samba brings a whole historical culture of food, varied dances (miudinho, coco, samba de roda, and pernada), parties, clothes such as linen shirts, and the NAIF painting of established names such as Nelson Sargento, Guilherme de Brito, and Heitor dos Prazeres. Anonymous community artists, including painters, sculptors, designers, and stylists, make the clothes, costumes, carnival floats, and cars, opening the doors of schools of samba. There are also a great tradition of Balroom samba in Brazil, with many styles. Samba de Gafieira is the style more famous in Rio de Janeiro, where comom people used to go to the gafieira parties since the 30's, and where the moves and identity of this dance has emerged, getting more and more different from its African, European, argentinian and cubam origins and influences.\n\nThe Samba National Day is celebrated on December 2. The date was established at the initiative of Luis Monteiro da Costa, an Alderman of Salvador, in honor of Ary Barroso. He composed \"Na Baixa do Sapateiro\" even though he had never been in Bahia. Thus 2 December marked the first visit of Ary Barroso to Salvador. Initially, this day was celebrated only in Salvador, but eventually it turned into a national holiday.\n\nSamba is a local style in Southeastern Brazil and Northeast Brazil, especially in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Salvador and Belo Horizonte. Its importance as Brazil's national music transcends region, however; samba schools, samba musicians and carnival organizations centered around the performance of samba exist in every region of the country and, while regional musics prevail in other regions (for instance, in Southern Brazil, Center-West Brazil, and all of the Brazilian countryside, Sertanejo, or Brazilian country music, is the most popular style).Since Rio de Janeiro is the most popular Brazilian city worldwide,usually samba is used to identify Brazilians as part of the same national culture.","songs":[{"id":"bBnczd6697","name":"Siempre Me Quedará","artist":"cF5U31f28"},{"id":"SzFT82a53","name":"Jardim","artist":"bbLQb9c3f"},{"id":"mQ62404c6f8","name":"Milonga Para as Missoes","artist":"K1m9102f"},{"id":"eQIO238131","name":"Tens (Calmaria)","artist":"5Iva2e25"},{"id":"xLqvr6d2113","name":"Mar Azul","artist":"bhYwd0196"},{"id":"ToDC81704","name":"Quando a Chuva Passar","artist":"bdfhc44c3"},{"id":"eqkmm2dbf1","name":"Primavera","artist":"BGS73bc3"},{"id":"mQ8vkA4e7a9","name":"Never Gonna Let You Go","artist":"4tc5e0a5"},{"id":"b9eW4db1e7","name":"O Rio Para Trás","artist":"CROb2e1e"},{"id":"8Gr6vte4810","name":"Somewhere Else","artist":"VHR9de32"},{"id":"b5F9cb20eb","name":"Hey","artist":"d3WU41a28"},{"id":"U5DmhA28220","name":"O Homem Falou (com Velha Guarda da Mangueira)","artist":"CcD8d1ec"}],"albums":[{"id":"j4eMb4f48","name":"Rosa","artist":"bbLQb9c3f"},{"id":"fRlZ720d3","name":"Acordeonista","artist":"K1m9102f"},{"id":"nelffb8ed","name":"Modo Livre","artist":"5Iva2e25"},{"id":"nn17Ot833ee","name":"大海","artist":"9cyxZyedf9d"},{"id":"DADp45bdf","name":"Celebration: A Musical Journey","artist":"4tc5e0a5"},{"id":"nLTCf5d42","name":"Perfil","artist":"bdfhc44c3"},{"id":"fL4Ne4817","name":"Garota Moderna","artist":"bhYwd0196"},{"id":"rSea1f3ff","name":"Berimbaum","artist":"BGS73bc3"},{"id":"fxB37bfdd","name":"MTV Ao Vivo","artist":"bdfhc44c3"},{"id":"0qES4c3ba","name":"Amorosa","artist":"bbLQb9c3f"},{"id":"eOsp50d4c","name":"Sergio Mendes Songs Selected b...","artist":"4tc5e0a5"},{"id":"3RkJ39a33","name":"Bebel Gilberto Remixed","artist":"VHR9de32"}],"artists":[{"id":"CROb2e1e","name":"Celso Fonseca"},{"id":"IbM5f057","name":"Agnes Jaoui"},{"id":"bdfhc44c3","name":"Ivete Sangalo"},{"id":"bcC6d790b","name":"Morelenbaum²"},{"id":"2VQab60a","name":"Carmen Miranda"},{"id":"mtkEz791def","name":"Elza Soares"},{"id":"bdcCc799a","name":"Emilio Santiago"},{"id":"bvKf73ba0","name":"Cartola"},{"id":"bb7z1579e","name":"Vinicius Cantuaria"},{"id":"dj8K393fa","name":"Trio Mocotó"},{"id":"d3WU41a28","name":"Alexandre Pires"},{"id":"dh4B365af","name":"Nonô"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1102","name":"古巴 | 颂乐 Son","description":"颂(Son)乐形成在1880年,不但是古巴的主流舞曲类型,也是影响整个拉丁美洲舞曲最重要的元素。它源自古巴东部的Oriente,这是一个融合多元族裔和丰富音乐文化的地方,主要因为1800年海地发生革命战役,数以千计的难民涌进此地,和古巴的非洲人与西班牙人又进行了一次文化血统的交流所致。因此颂乐不免散发出一种迷人的混血文化风采。可参考帕特巴斯拉的《马车夫》,和喜瑞拉梅斯特拉的《恶灵》、《百分百古巴》。\n最初的颂乐只是原始又朴素的东部乡村音乐,艺人多半用一种有着三对弦的古巴吉他(tres)自弹自唱,衬以古巴打击乐器沙铃(maracas)和刮葫(guiro)。经由奴隶的传唱传到哈瓦那后,为了取悦资产阶级,企图在乐风上壮大声势,于是乐器的编制渐渐变得复杂起来。这样的颂乐飘洋过海向北到了纽约,融合20年代盛行的爵士大乐队乐风就变成了Salsa,是纽约人耳熟能详的新兴乐风。如果颂乐向南进入南美洲,混入迷幻的电子合成乐,则成了商业化的哥伦比亚Salsa。\n1912年开始,美国的唱片公司到古巴录制颂乐专辑,接着各地广播电台也陆续成立,全国性甚至国际性的古巴艺人,终于要借着大众传播媒体站上舞台亮相了。当艺人有了更多元化的发展时,自然不愿被局限在制式的音乐传统里,于是帮颂乐变声的游戏开始。1927年曾经参与Sexteto Habanero的Felix Chapotin,首先尝试加入小喇叭;盲人吉他手Arsenio Rodriguez,则在他的乐团里加入更多的管乐、节奏和钢琴,此举果然投合大众口味,成为四零到五零年间最具影响力的乐团。古巴乐团的团长Beny More更酷,他干脆把颂的节奏加快,把慢板的bolero抒情舞曲改成超快板,创造出了Mambo。笛子和大提琴的介入,则是颂乐最后的变奏charanga,也是如今所能听到的最活泼的当代颂乐综合版。集合各大艺人在1979年录制的《哈瓦那之星》,收录颂乐在这个时期中所有变化的样貌,值得一听。\n可以说,颂乐在古巴,是一种永恒延续的声音。或许在每一个年代,它刻印出不同的标记,也许是mambo,也许是salsa…,但是骨子里,它永远是颂(Son)。\n\nThe Son cubano is a style of music and dance that originated in Cuba and gained worldwide popularity in the 1930s. Son combines the structure and elements of Spanish canción and the Spanish guitar with African rhythms and percussion instruments of Bantu origin. The Cuban son is one of the most influential and widespread forms of Latin American music: its derivatives and fusions, especially salsa, have spread across the world.\nThe word son (one of the words that translates to English 'rhythm' from Spanish) has also come to be used for other traditional rural musical styles of Spanish-speaking countries. For example, in Mexico the Son Jarocho of Veracruz and the Son Huasteco of the Sierra Huasteca constitute distinct popular musical genre. They are not derived from the Cuban son.","songs":[{"id":"b3WUMc31a8","name":"Chan Chan","artist":"4OA50c55"},{"id":"O3rU70919","name":"Guantanamera","artist":"ckTg2c142"},{"id":"fApua43085","name":"Tamacun","artist":"bzeFe4cf2"},{"id":"b9VRh14359","name":"La Sitiera","artist":"beuCab7d4"},{"id":"O4TN845cd","name":"Amor Verdadero","artist":"4P07fa63"},{"id":"8Ga8y4f6bc6","name":"Al Vaiven de Mi Carreta","artist":"bvOjea572"},{"id":"OcZY686b4","name":"Quizás, Quizás [Perhaps]","artist":"URka5e8e"},{"id":"mQ7RRb62446","name":"Rico Vacilon","artist":"bmyjcc1bb"},{"id":"bBaSRcf323","name":"Veinte Anos","artist":"EtM5b4bb"},{"id":"b3P96be639","name":"Ríe y Llora","artist":"4OL90e75"},{"id":"NElg6659d","name":"El Cumbanchero","artist":"UPV9ae9e"},{"id":"cjhYie4951","name":"Elegua Quiere Tambo","artist":"VIFcc10a"}],"albums":[{"id":"jfAqaeefa","name":"Buena Vista Social Club","artist":"4OA50c55"},{"id":"f2Ge4f26e","name":"Buena Vista Social Club Presen...","artist":"beuCab7d4"},{"id":"f348e745a","name":"At Carnegie Hall","artist":"4OA50c55"},{"id":"eSZL62efa","name":"Las Flores de la Vida","artist":"ckTg2c142"},{"id":"n3JKf8c0c","name":"Rodrigo y Gabriela","artist":"bzeFe4cf2"},{"id":"eSZP78a1a","name":"Duets","artist":"ckTg2c142"},{"id":"jEPyaa8a6","name":"Gracias","artist":"beuCab7d4"},{"id":"eSIxbfccc","name":"Mi Sueño","artist":"URka5e8e"},{"id":"jEPrb2fb6","name":"Flor de Amor","artist":"beuCab7d4"},{"id":"C2ll6ff73","name":"A Toda Cuba Le Gusta","artist":"4P07fa63"},{"id":"jKv19a84e","name":"The Cuban Legend","artist":"EtM5b4bb"},{"id":"fYVB683ed","name":"La Manigua","artist":"bmyjcc1bb"}],"artists":[{"id":"URka5e8e","name":"Ibrahim Ferrer"},{"id":"4OA50c55","name":"Buena Vista Social Club"},{"id":"beuCab7d4","name":"Omara Portuondo"},{"id":"ckTg2c142","name":"Compay Segundo"},{"id":"4OL90e75","name":"Celia Cruz"},{"id":"b4v81c103","name":"Eliades Ochoa"},{"id":"4P07fa63","name":"Afro-Cuban All Stars"},{"id":"dsdG38bc4","name":"AfroCubism"},{"id":"bmyjcc1bb","name":"Vieja Trova Santiaguera"},{"id":"UPV9ae9e","name":"Sabu Martinez"},{"id":"VJ9c17ff","name":"Sierra Maestra"},{"id":"bvOjea572","name":"Cuarteto Patria"}]},{"type":"style","id":"605","name":"蒙古 | 呼麦 Throat Singing","description":"“呼麦”是图瓦文xoomei的中文音译，又名“浩林·潮尔”，原义指“喉咙”，即为“喉音”，一种藉由喉咙紧缩而唱出“双声”的泛音咏唱技法。“双声”(biphonic)指一个人在演唱时能同时发出两个高低不同的声音。另外，呼麦又称“蒙古喉音”。呼麦作为一种歌咏方法，主要流传于中国内蒙古，南西伯利亚的图瓦、蒙古、阿尔泰和哈卡斯(Khakass)等地区。西藏密宗格鲁派的噶陀(Gyuto)、噶美(Gyume)两寺，也有使用低沉的喉音来唱诵经咒的传承。\n\n呼麦是一种古老的歌唱方式，声音从喉底里发出来，悠悠远远地往一个很深很深的隧道里面钻，那个隧道是时间的记忆。据说，呼麦已经有千年历史，而今已是蒙古国宝级的艺术，在全世界独一无二。国家非常重视非物质文化遗产的保护，2006年5月20日，蒙古族呼麦经国务院批准列入第一批国家级非物质文化遗产名录。2009年10月1日，中国蒙古族呼麦成功入选世界非物质文化遗产名录。\n\n\nThroat Singing is a type of singing in which the singer manipulates the resonances (or formants) created as air travels from the lungs, past the vocal folds, and out the lips to produce a melody.\nThe partials (fundamental and overtones) of a sound wave made by the human voice can be selectively amplified by changing the shape of the resonant cavities of the mouth, larynx and pharynx. This resonant tuning allows the singer to create apparently more than one pitch at the same time (the fundamental and a selected overtone), while in effect still generating a single fundamental frequency with his/her vocal folds.","songs":[{"id":"xL4X7Cadad4","name":"乌兰巴托之夜","artist":"fV2adbaf"},{"id":"b1wlRd47a3","name":"Old Melodie","artist":"VDfaaf4d"},{"id":"JALaGw24e45","name":"In Search of a Lost Past","artist":"VDd9a205"},{"id":"xLokNwcf31e","name":"Uils Dundaa Sain","artist":"FW657bcb"},{"id":"xL24i5b2876","name":"野花","artist":"bJmY3d4d5b7"},{"id":"mQJXpqda5f1","name":"吆呼尔","artist":"foDnS3209b8"},{"id":"LyDUbeeba","name":"Tuva Groove","artist":"5Cm77b07"},{"id":"xLovbsc420d","name":"Konturei","artist":"dCnC3dcac"},{"id":"mQNFp9a6a97","name":"Aldargan小草","artist":"UhNFwJ29a6f"},{"id":"mSJc9b591a8","name":"心之寻","artist":"iSAO974fe"},{"id":"mQLAjN67220","name":"骏马","artist":"czicJ3b3bcd"},{"id":"bAEqTb7e44","name":"Kamgalanyr Kuzhu-Daa Bar ","artist":"VDid86cb"}],"albums":[{"id":"eHEW76e6f","name":"Lost Rivers","artist":"VDfaaf4d"},{"id":"x2SC1Q181eb","name":"回到你身旁","artist":"fV2adbaf"},{"id":"fEGY8eaaf","name":"Eternal","artist":"VDd9a205"},{"id":"v4pm28c15","name":"Stepmother City","artist":"VDfaaf4d"},{"id":"xSV2brd3e0c","name":"拜访","artist":"fV2adbaf"},{"id":"8j3miHe644c","name":"鸿雁","artist":"fV2adbaf"},{"id":"xHNuVud5186","name":"走唱·西北 内蒙杭盖乐队专场","artist":"fV2adbaf"},{"id":"xo1drfac697","name":"Cliffhanging Red Flower","artist":"bJmY3d4d5b7"},{"id":"fAx287c5c","name":"Zazal","artist":"FW657bcb"},{"id":"yhSwSfc71aa","name":"精选集","artist":"iSAO974fe"},{"id":"fc5xJP25938","name":"走马电台","artist":"bJmY3d4d5b7"},{"id":"eHEU5d040","name":"Back Tuva Future","artist":"5Cm77b07"}],"artists":[{"id":"fV2adbaf","name":"杭盖"},{"id":"VDfaaf4d","name":"Sainkho Namtchylak"},{"id":"VDd9a205","name":"Huun-Huur-Tu"},{"id":"EZ188327","name":"旅行者"},{"id":"VDid86cb","name":"Yat-Kha"},{"id":"eCwI65007","name":"铁骑乐队"},{"id":"FW657bcb","name":"Egschiglen"},{"id":"bJmY3d4d5b7","name":"HorseRadio"},{"id":"5Cm77b07","name":"Kongar-ol Ondar"},{"id":"bkwVcaade","name":"阿基耐"},{"id":"foDnS3209b8","name":"奈热乐队"},{"id":"dCnC3dcac","name":"Chirgilchin"}]},{"type":"style","id":"506","name":"世界融合 World Fusion","description":"World Fusion 指第三世界音乐的融合，也指融合了爵士乐的世界音乐,尤指融合了异教徒音乐，非西方音乐，以及新音乐三方面的元素。 异教徒音乐混合了爵士乐的即兴方式（拉丁爵士）；通常，其中独奏的部分更多的使用即兴爵士乐 ，而伴奏和合成部分则和异教徒音乐一样。第二种元素也是以融合了特定的非西方音乐的爵士乐为主。比如Dizzy Gillespies 在“突尼斯之夜”中的表演；70年代Keith Jarretees录制的四重奏，其中合声和中东乐器的使用；50年代到90年代Sun Ras也融合了非洲音乐的节奏；Yusef Lateefs录制的一些唱片也兼容了传统伊斯兰乐器和配乐方式。第三种元素则是受到新音乐的影响，显著的变化来自于爵士的即兴革新创作：乐器，合声，合成实践，以及已有的异教徒传统韵律。尽管这样的融合具有独创性，但仍能反映出非爵士，异教徒的传统。比如Don Cherrys，Codona and Nu；John McLaughlins从70年代到90年代的一些音乐很大程度地吸取了印度的传统音乐；而Don Ellis 70年代也借鉴了不少印度和保加利亚的音乐； Andy Narrell 在90年代则把特立尼达岛的音乐与乐器和即兴爵士，funk style 融合起来。World Fusion 并不是和现代爵士一起首次出现，其发展趋势并没有游离在美国爵士之外。举例来说，波力尼西亚音乐在20世纪初融入了西方流行音乐 ，吸引了早起的爵士音乐家。加勒比海舞蹈的节奏在整个20世界成为了美国流行文化的一个重要组成部分，而爵士音乐家们越来越多的汲取流行音乐元素势必使这种融合继续下去。Django Reinhardt 30年代的音乐，融合了吉普赛音乐，法国即兴爵士以及印象派室内乐。\n\nWorld Fusion refers to a fusion of Third World music, but the term also refers to world music with jazz, specifically with one of three subgenres (ethnic, non-Western, and new music). The ethnic music subgenre has incorporated jazz improvisations (for example, Latin jazz); frequently, only the solos are improvised jazz. The accompaniments and compositions are essentially the same as the ethnic music.\n\nThe second subgenre features jazz that has incorporated limited aspects of a particular non-Western music. Examples include performances of Dizzy Gillespie's \"A Night in Tunisia\"; music on some of the 1970s' quartet recordings by Keith Jarrett's quartet and quintet on Impulse, in which Middle Eastern instruments and harmonic methods are modified and used; some of Sun Ra's music from the 1950s into the 1990s, in which African rhythms are incorporated; and some of Yusef Lateef's recordings that feature traditional Islamic instruments and methods.\n\nThe last subgenre of world fusion with jazz influences consists of new musical styles that result from distinctly original ways of combining jazz improvisation with innovative ideas -- and the instruments, harmonies, compositional practices, and rhythms of an existing ethnic tradition. The product is original, but its flavor still reflects some aspects of a non-jazz, ethnic tradition. Examples include Don Cherry's bands Codona and Nu; some of John McLaughlin's music from the 1970s and the 1990s that drew heavily on the traditions of India; some of Don Ellis' music of the 1970s that drew on the music of India and Bulgaria; and work by Andy Narrell in the 1990s that melds the music and instruments of Trinidad with jazz improvisations and funk styles.\n\nWorld fusion jazz did not first occur with modern jazz, and its trends are not exclusive to American jazz. For instance, Polynesian music was fusing with Western pop styles at the beginning of the 20th century, and its feeling attracted some of the earliest jazz musicians. Caribbean dance rhythms have been a significant part of American pop culture throughout the 20th century, and since jazz musicians frequently improvised when performing in pop music contexts, blends have been occurring almost continuously. Django Reinhardt was melding the traditions of Gypsy music with French impressionist concert music and jazz improvisation during the 1930s in France. Also see Latin jazz and jazz-rock fusion. -- Mark C. Gridley\n\n\nThe subgenre world fusion is often mistakenly assumed to refer exclusively to a blending of Western jazz fusion elements with world music. Although such a hybrid expression falls easily into the world fusion category, the suffix \"fusion\" in the term world fusion should not be assumed to mean only jazz fusion. Western jazz combined with strong elements of world music is more accurately termed world fusion jazz, ethnic jazz or non-Western jazz. World fusion and global fusion are nearly synonymous with the genre term worldbeat, and though these are considered subgenres of popular music, they may also imply universal expressions of the more general term, world music. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, fusion in the jazz music genre implied a blending of jazz and rock music, which is where the misleading assumption is rooted.\n\nThe world fusion genre at JMA is not just a collection of world beat artists, but is instead a collection of artists who bring world beat influences to the ever expanding world of jazz fusion. Since fusion artists from the US, Western Europe and Latin America are usually covered in our other fusion genres, the world fusion genre typically carries fusion artists with African, Asian, Middle Eastern and East European influences.\n\nOnce again though, the world fusion artists at JMA also display the improvisational aspects and virtuoso soloing associated with jazz and fusion.","songs":[{"id":"ckjI4ed732","name":"Tango Flamenco","artist":"buPDe8e9a"},{"id":"kc8Dc469d","name":"万物生","artist":"fKjd0979"},{"id":"cMzv324ecf","name":"The Girl from Ipanema","artist":"bsTGfec82"},{"id":"cgRCn1b7b1","name":"Wana Be-Ied Annak (When I Am Not Near You)","artist":"3ps4c014"},{"id":"OQ2o7d81c","name":"Memoria da Noite","artist":"bwtded614"},{"id":"bf0wR9b2fbca","name":"迷路的羊羔","artist":"eckt4a644"},{"id":"R4da6e70c","name":"Twilight","artist":"b00ufc6ea"},{"id":"bCkA5SH4b132","name":"旅行者","artist":"EZ188327"},{"id":"bBnczd6697","name":"Siempre Me Quedará","artist":"cF5U31f28"},{"id":"bBonxd65c3","name":"Tu Sonrisa","artist":"bVKm1f2aa"},{"id":"NzMw68eb8","name":"The Carnival Is Over","artist":"Ty29baa1"},{"id":"b2Vjiaf496","name":"The Girl from Ipanema","artist":"4tn8f358"}],"albums":[{"id":"eTBR7dd02","name":"Gypsy Flame","artist":"buPDe8e9a"},{"id":"YBfc9e83","name":"万物生","artist":"fKjd0979"},{"id":"gkwC70d84","name":"迁徙","artist":"eckt4a644"},{"id":"HuA5879d","name":"Getz/Gilberto","artist":"bsTGfec82"},{"id":"fJyy647b3","name":"天地合","artist":"fKjd0979"},{"id":"4wA13bb2e","name":"Twilight","artist":"b00ufc6ea"},{"id":"PFV70d82","name":"Sabla Tolo, Vol. 2: Further Jo...","artist":"3ps4c014"},{"id":"0Rfn2f54d","name":"旅行者","artist":"EZ188327"},{"id":"r4dd241b7","name":"Lost in Paradise","artist":"buPDe8e9a"},{"id":"vHuH26183","name":"Hai Un Paraiso","artist":"bwtded614"},{"id":"eR2n8ef3d","name":"Viva Cugat!","artist":"buGSfb836"},{"id":"gpIKb6230","name":"就是这个调调","artist":"c35k43eb1"}],"artists":[{"id":"eckt4a644","name":"HAYA乐团"},{"id":"fKjd0979","name":"萨顶顶"},{"id":"VDfaaf4d","name":"Sainkho Namtchylak"},{"id":"GCl5b77c","name":"Choying Drolma"},{"id":"e2P6806d","name":"吴金黛"},{"id":"xFMYfmb6ed1","name":"Tie Yann"},{"id":"Tqg15224","name":"Astor Piazzolla"},{"id":"VDd9a205","name":"Huun-Huur-Tu"},{"id":"JNP69039","name":"Howie Lee"},{"id":"cXr4ec6f","name":"常静"},{"id":"c35k43eb1","name":"戏班"},{"id":"Gpu8d7fd","name":"吉田兄弟"}]},{"type":"style","id":"513","name":"世界节拍 Worldbeat","description":"Worldbeat is a music genre that blends Western pop music or rock music with traditional, folk or world music influences.

It is used by listeners for yoga, massage, meditation,and reading as a method of stress management or to create a peaceful atmosphere in their home or other environments, and is often associated with environmentalism and New Age spirituality.\nThe harmonies in New Age music are generally modal, consonant, or include a drone bass. The melodies are sometimes recordings of nature sounds and used as an introduction to a track or throughout the piece. Pieces of up to thirty minutes are common.\nNew Age music includes both electronic forms, frequently relying on sustained synth pads or long sequencer-based runs, and acoustic forms, featuring instruments such as flutes, piano, acoustic guitar and a wide variety of non-western acoustic instruments.\nVocal arrangements were initially rare in New Age music but as it has evolved vocals have

Carlos Nakai（美国本土笛乐）。90年代早期，Enigma, Dead Can Dance和Deep Forest又在这种音乐中引入了俱乐部跳舞节奏以及混音技术，其应用可以从欧洲中世纪音乐直到采样的非洲土著音乐。但尽管如此，这种音乐也很少可能有更大的市场突破。\n\nEthnic Fusion is not to be confused with world fusion (a synthesis of jazz and world music) or worldbeat (which may draw from any number of world musics, often adding a Western pop influence). Instead, ethnic fusion is generally rooted in the sounds and philosophies of new age music, seeking to incorporate traditional ethnic folk musics into contemporary electronic music. Often, though not always, the aim is to find ways to create unity and harmony between Western technology and more earth- and nature-oriented cultures. Jazz musicians like Tony Scott and Don Cherry were some of the first to synthesize world music with Western forms, and minimalist composers like Terry Riley and Philip Glass sometimes drew upon non-Western scales and structures. These experiments informed early ethnic fusion, most notably the music of Jon Hassell, who helped establish the style during the late '70s and early '80s with his solo work and his collaborations with ambient pioneer Brian Eno. In time, ethnic fusion became a favorite way for adventurous contemporary instrumental musicians to broaden their sound with new rhythms or non-Western instrumentation; others came naturally to a particular ethnic music and fused it with a contemporary instrumental/new age sensibility. Artists in the latter category included Clannad (Celtic folk), Ottmar Liebert (flamenco), Kitaro (Japanese folk melodies), and R. Carlos Nakai (Native American flute music). During the early '90s, ethnic fusion artists like Enigma, Dead Can Dance, and Deep Forest found a wider audience with the introduction of club-ready dance beats into the mix, which could feature anything from medieval European music to sampled field recordings of African pygmies. But even if there were very few larger commercial breakthroughs, ethnic fusion maintained a degree of popularity through the remainder of the '90s.","songs":[{"id":"ckjI4ed732","name":"Tango Flamenco","artist":"buPDe8e9a"},{"id":"OJ4Oaf605","name":"The Mass","artist":"bwlx19c9f"},{"id":"b86Yedfe93","name":"That Place in Your Heart","artist":"Caq71aac"},{"id":"cin13f4165","name":"Return to Innocence","artist":"dafJ3a958"},{"id":"UtL7734fc","name":"Idé Weré Weré","artist":"EGy76a34"},{"id":"b8yxhd4ba2","name":"Forest Hymn","artist":"bbNL99852"},{"id":"f4EkP3f905","name":"Amarantine","artist":"3Aj5a9bf"},{"id":"em9zk34893","name":"Highlands","artist":"WnQb8acc"},{"id":"Vn3672d8c","name":"Sun Circle","artist":"bfDR9dfc4"},{"id":"mQLHhr5982a","name":"水","artist":"eFWpbd786"},{"id":"xLreYue09af","name":"Gentle Rain","artist":"bOYt1ecd9"},{"id":"xLpJuSaff05","name":"七秀坊","artist":"duR735448"}],"albums":[{"id":"vGMP282c8","name":"The Mass","artist":"bwlx19c9f"},{"id":"eTBR7dd02","name":"Gypsy Flame","artist":"buPDe8e9a"},{"id":"xAgRjOa3bdb","name":"茶禅一味","artist":"eFWpbd786"},{"id":"j5kYb8b0d","name":"Anthem","artist":"Caq71aac"},{"id":"opGXfcae7","name":"《剑侠情缘网络版3》 原声大碟","artist":"duR735448"},{"id":"eibl1Zf454b","name":"天籁秦音 原声配乐大碟","artist":"eIPQ8bb39"},{"id":"3VCM5f444","name":"The Cross of Changes","artist":"dafJ3a958"},{"id":"jGJza0b85","name":"Love Is Space","artist":"EGy76a34"},{"id":"fsfe4c9f0","name":"A Place Called Morning","artist":"bbNL99852"},{"id":"eTO6a8dee","name":"MCMXC a.D.

其中后者采取了和原乐队完全相反的音乐手法，他们丰富了太空摇滚的声音，使得它更加豪华、轻柔、像管弦乐一般宏大，而这一切最终使他们成为了这种风格中最受欢迎的一支乐队。大部分后来的乐队要不就是奉行极简的方法，要不就是像 Spiritualized 一样极其奢华；偶尔他们还会在音乐中加入后摇滚与独立摇滚的元素。\n\n\n　　太空声响音乐的浮出\n\n\n　　和上面这些音乐家们创作的音乐不同的是，另一类关于太空的音乐也越来越受到人们的关注。这就是太空声响音乐。这个概念来自于具像音乐，是指将大自然中的各类声响利用磁带录制下来以后，通过调整转速和重叠等方法创造出新的声音，往往带来超现实的听觉体验。太空声响音乐承袭了这一观念，将美国宇航局发射到太空中的探测器录下各个行星发出的电波音频(原先是人耳无法听见的)，以电子设备转换到我们的可听频率内，目前已经有如土星光环，天王星的卫星米兰达，天王星，木星的最小的卫星等星体发出的自然星体音乐。\n\n\n　　美国宇航局发射的飞往木星的探测器“卡西尼”号也收到了从木星上传来的一种非常怪异的音乐旋律，这是一种低频无线电波，据称这种电波被转化成声音之后听起来很像一种奇怪的民间音乐。科学家们说这些信号并非生命活动的迹象，而是在太阳风(solar wind)扫过木星强大的磁场时发生的一种现象。太阳风是从太阳发散出的一薄层带电粒子形成的气体。它碰到行星时和海浪拍打水上的船体时的效果一样。专家们认为这种碰撞就是引起这种电磁“太空音乐”的原因，这种声音是在距离木星2300万公里时收到的。\n\n\n　　宇宙是如此神秘，太空这么遥远，和这些相比，人类的喜怒哀乐似乎是那么地微不足道。但是这些情感也许是我们唯一可以握在手中的东西，人类正是在所有的这些情感的激发下，创造了另一个世界。也许一个人永远都无法知道宇宙是什么，但他仍然可以通过音乐去幻想，去创造，去开始一个心灵的宇宙。","songs":[{"id":"b8yxhd4ba2","name":"Forest Hymn","artist":"bbNL99852"},{"id":"xL0Z1Hdd1bb","name":"面壁者","artist":"bf7pARr2d814"},{"id":"cpo7D2f1fa","name":"Enter the Sacred","artist":"bToE1e61f"},{"id":"esXig33d80","name":"Gopinatha","artist":"bf9C16175"},{"id":"cnePHe3e14","name":"At the Temple of Rameses the Great","artist":"ZT6f5eb7"},{"id":"xNZFKzc77d1","name":"流浪地球","artist":"nmS3P378f47"},{"id":"fCArH3d873","name":"Pavane de la Belle au Bois Dormant","artist":"bc4b96fc1"},{"id":"mQ7aHM5d20b","name":"Pachelbel’s Canon In D Major","artist":"5Qa930bf"},{"id":"bqve5Or36d28","name":"Conga Jog","artist":"bkFva2bd4"},{"id":"xL1um2ce6dd","name":"Angels Gather on High","artist":"bztSf44f0"},{"id":"MJsZ8effe","name":"The Magic and Beauty of Sedona","artist":"clTs2c8e4"},{"id":"JAMxYG20b1b","name":"Teach Me to Whisper","artist":"Jbu8d066"}],"albums":[{"id":"dGn95Sfed50","name":"三体OST","artist":"bf7pARr2d814"},{"id":"fsfe4c9f0","name":"A Place Called Morning","artist":"bbNL99852"},{"id":"sjlA20513","name":"Devotion","artist":"bf9C16175"},{"id":"fyl47ba8c","name":"Drum Medicine","artist":"bToE1e61f"},{"id":"iQpKb946f","name":"Sound Medicine: Music for Heal...","artist":"5Qa930bf"},{"id":"nGxee2bce","name":"Deep Peace","artist":"bbNL99852"},{"id":"fjBx70f84","name":"Enchanted Egypt","artist":"ZT6f5eb7"},{"id":"nGxhf89ec","name":"Eternity's Sunrise","artist":"bbNL99852"},{"id":"iQptceeee","name":"Gifts of the Angels","artist":"5Qa930bf"},{"id":"ro7K210c9","name":"Chakra Suite","artist":"5Qa930bf"},{"id":"eEfI67412","name":"Connections [live]","artist":"5Qa930bf"},{"id":"f8K54e1f1","name":"Union","artist":"bf9C16175"}],"artists":[{"id":"VQLab6cb","name":"Mychael Danna"},{"id":"yiuqxna86a3","name":"No Play"},{"id":"5Qa930bf","name":"Steven Halpern"},{"id":"bToE1e61f","name":"David & Steve Gordon"},{"id":"VRkbb0fb","name":"Steve Roach"},{"id":"b1j0uxH42bae","name":"RPZ"},{"id":"ZT6f5eb7","name":"Phil Thornton"},{"id":"bc4b96fc1","name":"Riley Lee"},{"id":"iQbcc3a7a","name":"Jason Casper"},{"id":"bkFva2bd4","name":"Al Gromer Khan"},{"id":"5Qo7a20c","name":"Robert Rich"},{"id":"Bhr710c7","name":"Michael Stearns"}]},{"type":"style","id":"736","name":"放松新世纪 Relaxation New Age","description":"冥想放松（可以看作是一种高级的打盹方式）。在New Age风行的今日，冥想成为New Agers实践的一种重要方式，同时也产生了配合这种方式的音乐。在New Age音乐中就有很多的音乐就是专门为冥想活动而做的（有时是不太适合当音乐来听的）。这种音乐一般没有明显的节奏，音乐上表现地平滑、流畅，使听者能够放松身心，有时音乐家们也会借助一些自然的声效来加强意境的渲染。\nArguably, all music can be said to be useful for Meditation. The styles, cadences, arpeggiations, and rhythms of meditational music for contemplative practices is characteristically different than most other forms of music. Generally speaking, the music is relaxing, lacking definitive rhythms. Meditation and music have been relational partners for centuries. Mellow, repetitive, and redundant sequences of smoothly contoured melodic lines help to relax the mind as arrhythmic tempos do not distract the listener into a beat but rather a flow. Harmonies are often absent unless one accepts the musical nuance of imitation as structured harmony. Meditation music can also include recordings of sounds in the \"natural\" world: rainfall, waterfalls, birds, insects, whales, and others, separately and in synthetic combination. -- Keith Johnson","songs":[{"id":"ckDGUfffdb","name":"Snowdreams","artist":"6iG76183"},{"id":"ckM1Ffe2ed","name":"Bressanone  ","artist":"dSzx4862d"},{"id":"xLs49abee29","name":"The Sound Of Silence","artist":"yhRvbPc4203"},{"id":"xLrsTa9c347","name":"Dancing in the Moonlight","artist":"bkstcc886"},{"id":"ONtd86e5f","name":"Moon Temple ","artist":"6ot94961"},{"id":"coF4Sf8da2","name":"Tonight I Celebrate My Love","artist":"b2tDe987f"},{"id":"fEz2T3d772","name":"Origins","artist":"Wsga6fd7"},{"id":"bqvbDr538106","name":"Uno","artist":"VQNca2f2"},{"id":"fARIg69d32","name":"Amy's Lullaby","artist":"ZTtd706d"},{"id":"mQ7O2w70c1d","name":"Gentle Slumber","artist":"V6zc6bfc"},{"id":"8GrgBqf4bf7","name":"卡农：遇见情人节","artist":"m053hU4bf12"},{"id":"UIo84daaf","name":"Jap Man Sat Nam","artist":"b5hLefb7f"}],"albums":[{"id":"ol4mfbfcd","name":"Bandari 20th Anniversary Colle...","artist":"6iG76183"},{"id":"ns1g19499","name":"Sunny Bay","artist":"6iG76183"},{"id":"ns1dfb1d2","name":"One Day In Spring","artist":"6iG76183"},{"id":"eUjb9133d","name":"Mist","artist":"6iG76183"},{"id":"ns1bf3819","name":"Silence With Sound From Nature","artist":"6iG76183"},{"id":"jgrYab829","name":"Wonderland","artist":"6iG76183"},{"id":"nsN5f05a0","name":"Zen Breakfast","artist":"6ot94961"},{"id":"fpie8dc52","name":"Magic Piano","artist":"yhRvbPc4203"},{"id":"jgZja8755","name":"Bleeding Wolves","artist":"dSzx4862d"},{"id":"01KB314ef","name":"Relaxation - Fortune","artist":"6iG76183"},{"id":"eUji6d479","name":"Moonlight Bay","artist":"6iG76183"},{"id":"jgscaed5e","name":"Heaven Blue","artist":"6iG76183"}],"artists":[{"id":"6iG76183","name":"Bandari"},{"id":"Wsga6fd7","name":"Dan Gibson"},{"id":"dSzx4862d","name":"Matthew Lien"},{"id":"6ot94961","name":"Karunesh"},{"id":"vox418ff","name":"何真真"},{"id":"CrN6fa06","name":"Tom Barabas"},{"id":"b0CN178bb","name":"Nicholas Gunn"},{"id":"BKZ8a5e5","name":"Aeoliah"},{"id":"5Qa930bf","name":"Steven Halpern"},{"id":"iP26f617d","name":"甲雍"},{"id":"bR562342e","name":"Kim Robertson"},{"id":"ZT6f5eb7","name":"Phil Thornton"}]},{"type":"style","id":"745","name":"凯尔特新世纪 Celtic New Age","description":"Celtic New Age is a hybrid of Celtic themes, instrumentation, and songs, plus new age production and sensibilities.

Like blues -- the two genres often shared themes, melodies and songs -- country is a simple music at its core. Most of its songs are built around three chords and a plain melody, but these forms are so basic, they allow for many different styles, from the gritty sounds of honky tonk to the jazzy improvisations of Western Swing. Country music grew out of American Southern folk music, both Appalachian and blues, and old-time country was simple and folky, with just guitars and fiddles. As the genre progressed, old time music evolved into the rhythmic guitar-and-fiddle driven traditional country that became the foundation of modern country music, from honky tonk and Western Swing to the pop-oriented Countrypolitan and rock-inflected Bakersfield Sound.","songs":[{"id":"b1pOBSK3f088","name":"Stay Here Forever","artist":"3A471bd5"},{"id":"8Gasnd1cabc","name":"Need You Now (Single Version)","artist":"WfKc4a9a"},{"id":"xLzhAa9a12a","name":"I Knew You Were Trouble","artist":"6iJ73478"},{"id":"dCfw32c7fa","name":"Love Story","artist":"6iJ73478"},{"id":"8GchPJfeb66","name":"If I Die Young","artist":"dGiF4396d"},{"id":"cQHSq1fb63","name":"When You Say Nothing at All","artist":"btj0f116e"},{"id":"bqvdSbl3afb8","name":"One Match","artist":"dT5x43d2a"},{"id":"b1pN7sI3e484","name":"The End Of The World","artist":"3g179449"},{"id":"UOGE91081","name":"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of American folk music and Western music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, fiddles, and harmonicas.\nThe term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.","songs":[{"id":"bCkE7GE480f0","name":"Safe And Sound","artist":"MmF7fb3a"},{"id":"xLyy84a12b3","name":"Jingle Bells","artist":"bnNFd451b"},{"id":"JAQlxZ1e81e","name":"Tasmania","artist":"b0zs172a9"},{"id":"b1qf3YC3e1eb","name":"Lay Low","artist":"Wj1bbe46"},{"id":"8FZU32e47db","name":"Love Lives On","artist":"ecYk44035"},{"id":"U7gV8Y292d7","name":"Better Man","artist":"Xb7b0be8"},{"id":"xLsQmT9c2b3","name":"The Worst Part","artist":"bmxCa657b"},{"id":"mQ8jIx81c41","name":"Naleigh Moon","artist":"67r4c298"},{"id":"bf0CVZY30e6f","name":"Uptown Funk","artist":"dGiF4396d"},{"id":"xLJj0zc2162","name":"Setting the World on Fire","artist":"VmWd977e"},{"id":"xLwLoEd72ef","name":"This Place","artist":"ncQL1b8f7"},{"id":"mQW71o7a1a8","name":"Different for Girls","artist":"bza9e2c31"}],"albums":[{"id":"k058be96d","name":"Safe & Sound (From \"The Hunger...","artist":"6iJ73478"},{"id":"kG2Qa11a1","name":"Christmas with Scotty McCreery","artist":"bnNFd451b"},{"id":"9cAy8Jeafb6","name":"Love Story (Live from BBC 1's ...","artist":"6iJ73478"},{"id":"xkMi0y9db8f","name":"Taylor Swift Karaoke: 1989","artist":"6iJ73478"},{"id":"nnl5Sc90081","name":"stages","artist":"rpzp1f7ab"},{"id":"n59Cf2ba5","name":"Romance in Venice","artist":"cF4C2dd34"},{"id":"yhEZydd589a","name":"East","artist":"AfX8c25a"},{"id":"5gNm36141","name":"Julia Sheer","artist":"L71ccc95"},{"id":"yhAG1Ea7081","name":"We Are Never Ever Getting Back...","artist":"6iJ73478"},{"id":"kpIAbffd5","name":"Unreleased Songs","artist":"6iJ73478"},{"id":"mTtSky5f45a","name":"Lay Low","artist":"Wj1bbe46"},{"id":"gg0U903cf","name":"Come Find Me","artist":"b0zs172a9"}],"artists":[{"id":"cjj825adc","name":"Johnny Cash"},{"id":"btlwf20c3","name":"Shania Twain"},{"id":"gSJ9e259","name":"藤田恵美"},{"id":"evh91976","name":"LOVE PSYCHEDELICO"},{"id":"3h0810ff","name":"Alan Jackson"},{"id":"dGiF4396d","name":"The Band Perry"},{"id":"3ir5ee6c","name":"Willie Nelson"},{"id":"Lbi10b89","name":"小5"},{"id":"eaa9622","name":"蔡兴国"},{"id":"TkIbfce0","name":"Hank Williams"},{"id":"Tjydbfdb","name":"Dolly Parton"},{"id":"iR1l9b6e1","name":"Thomas Rhett"}]},{"type":"style","id":"469","name":"当代乡村 Contemporary Country","description":"Contemporary Country出现于70年代末期，以George Strait和Randy Travis为首的乡村歌手们回归根源乡村音乐，但加入了电吉他和鼓，使此类型乡村音乐更接近摇滚、流行乐化。\n\n当代乡村是具有美国民族特色的流行音乐。早期，不同于流行摇滚乐那样有属于自己的俱乐部、录音公司、电视节目，乡村音乐多传播于电台，电台播音也是他们唯一可以扬名的媒介。到了后期，随着信息媒介的日益发达，当代乡村音乐也越来越多的被广大群众所熟知，而不仅限于南部地区，从95年恢复的格莱美最佳乡村专辑，到独立的乡村音乐学院奖，在美国主流的Billboard榜单也可以看到乡村歌曲取得好成绩。\n\n田纳西州Nashville是美国乡村音乐的发源地，在美国有很大影响，现在已经成为乡村音乐的代名词，像其他特有风格的厂牌一样，你会见到例如Mercury Nashville、Capitol Nashville、\tSony Nashville、Arista Nashville等，可以说看到Nashville的字样就应该想到这张专辑的大风格了～\n\n当代乡村音乐和流行乐、摇滚乐在歌曲主题还是小有不同，前者有八大主题：一、爱情；二、失恋；三、牛仔幽默；四、找乐；五、乡村生活方式；六、地区的骄傲；七、家庭；八、上帝与国家。前两个主题绝不是乡村音乐所独有，但是后六大主题则把当代乡村与其他音乐流派区分开来。简而言之，乡村的人们有他们自己的幽默感；喜欢牛仔风格的疯玩；以一种与城市人很不同的方式生活；以自己所在的乡镇、州、地区为荣；极为重视家庭；不羞于表达宗教情感与爱国情感。\n\nFollowing the rise of the pop-oriented Urban Cowboy style in the late '70s and early '80s, singers like George Strait and Randy Travis set their sights on bringing country music back to its roots, beginning a movement known as the New Traditionalists. While their sound drew primarily on classic honky tonk, it also boasted all the advantages of updated production techniques and equipment, proving that pure country music could sound authentic yet modern. At its outset, Contemporary Country built upon this revelation, taking the foundation laid by new traditionalist country and infusing it with pop/rock sensibilities — without sounding wimpy. During the late '80s and early '90s, contemporary country was still essentially country at its core, even though it was reaching a wider audience than ever, thanks in no small part to Garth Brooks and his latent rock influences. Although pop-crossover hit singles were still a rare occurrence at this point, contemporary country albums began to sell in unprecedented numbers in the wake of Brooks' success, and while contemporary country was by no means restricted to male singers, they — with a few notable exceptions — were the main early beneficiaries of the music's greater visibility. This wave of male artists dominated the early to mid-'90s, mixing country grit and simple, line-dance-ready songcraft in varying proportions, with the new traditionalist movement continuing to hold a strong influence over many; some of the less substantive in the bunch were dubbed \"hat acts,\" after what cynics described as their most appealing attribute. All of the increased exposure eventually pulled contemporary country farther and farther into mainstream pop music, and a number of (mostly) female artists began to actively pursue crossover success; in the most pronounced cases, their music differentiated itself from full-fledged pop/rock only by a certain twang in the vocals. While shifting contemporary country away from its roots, this willingness to play to an even wider audience resulted in massive, genre-dominating popularity for acts like Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes, the Dixie Chicks, and Faith Hill in the late '90s.

Everywhere else I'm too Country”。\n\nPrior to the rise of rock & roll, country music was rarely heard outside of its intended market, effectively isolating it from any concerns about wide accessibility. When rockabilly took off, however, country musicians were forced to consider whether their true affinities lay with traditional country or with this popular new style, which allowed artists to reach crossover audiences for the first time. This flirtation with the mainstream marked the beginnings of country-pop, which grew out of the realization that country-influenced music (as opposed to straight-ahead honky tonk) could be hybridized and smoothed out for mass consumption. RCA Records producer Chet Atkins was the most important figure in the initial cross-breeding of country and pop, creating a sound that was dubbed \"countrypolitan\" for its blend of rural sensibility and urban sophistication. Because the melodies and song structures of country music were usually very simple and catchy, they worked well when placed in a pop-oriented format; Atkins' productions often placed the songs in orchestral arrangements heavy on the strings, which sometimes blended with country instrumentation and sometimes stood alone. This approach resulted in a bevy of pop crossover hits for singers who could make the transition to Atkins' smooth, polished style, most notably Jim Reeves. Decca Records producer Owen Bradley crafted an even lusher sound for his artists, most importantly providing the sympathetic sonic environment that best showcased the angelic voice of Patsy Cline, and making her a star in the process. Countrypolitan pop eventually came to be tagged \"the Nashville Sound,\" since nearly all of its records were produced there. But even as its practitioners racked up hit after hit, the first of many backlashes against country-pop began to form in the 1960s among artists frustrated at not fitting into the Nashville mold; the biggest came in the form of the Bakersfield sound, with its hard-driving beat, electric instrumentation, and love of old-style honky tonk. Nevertheless, the Nashville sound continued to prosper among fans of mainstream-oriented country. In fact, it became more popular than ever during the '70s thanks to producer Billy Sherrill, whose orchestrations and recordings were even more grandiose and detailed, and owed as much to \"Wall of Sound\" rock producer Phil Spector as they did to Atkins and Bradley; George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Charlie Rich, and Conway Twitty all benefited immensely from his touch. A simpler country-pop sound, which more closely resembled pop/rock with country trappings, also made inroads on non-country radio during the decade, thanks in part to country-rock fusion efforts by Bob Dylan, the Byrds, and the Flying Burrito Brothers; this sound was spearheaded by artists like Glen Campbell, John Denver and B.J. Thomas. The mid-'70s saw another rebellion in the edgier, more eclectic form of outlaw country, but by the end of the decade, the film Urban Cowboy had popularized a new variation on country-pop (named after the film), which smoothed the music out even more by blending it with soft-rock influences. During the mid- to late '80s, the new traditionalist movement sought to return country to its honky tonk roots, but its polished (yet not elaborate) production helped lay the groundwork for a new breed of country-pop that was informed by rock & roll, both in its driving beat and its big-sounding production techniques. This sound made Garth Brooks a superstar during the '90s and brought pop crossover success to Billy Ray Cyrus; toward the end of the decade, the emphasis had shifted to female vocalists like Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes, and Faith Hill, whose brands of country-pop could encompass soft-rock covers, roots-rock, or arena-rock-style production.","songs":[{"id":"b1pOBSK3f088","name":"Stay Here Forever","artist":"3A471bd5"},{"id":"8Gasnd1cabc","name":"Need You Now (Single Version)","artist":"WfKc4a9a"},{"id":"xLzhAa9a12a","name":"I Knew You Were Trouble","artist":"6iJ73478"},{"id":"cQHSq1fb63","name":"When You Say Nothing at All","artist":"btj0f116e"},{"id":"b1pN7sI3e484","name":"The End Of The World","artist":"3g179449"},{"id":"UOGE91081","name":"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!

In the '40s, country music began to splinter into different directions, as honky tonk and country-pop became genres of their own. A certain segment of country musicians continued playing traditional string music. Led by Bill Monroe, these musicians adhered to the songs, structures, and conventions of string bands, but they made the music faster, harder, and more technically demanding. The result was bluegrass; the genre was named after Bill Monroe's backing band, the Blue Grass Boys. After its inception in the mid-'40s, and its popularization in the '50s, the sound had become part of country music, and there were legions of bands that followed in their footsteps. In the late '60s, a number of bluegrass groups began expanding the possibilities of the genre, much to the chagrin of many of the music's most popular artists and dedicated fans. Consequently, the new breed of bluegrass groups were dubbed progressive bluegrass, while those that adhered to the music's heritage were tagged traditional bluegrass. Over the next three decades, progressive bluegrass changed frequently, while the sound of traditional bluegrass rarely varied.","songs":[{"id":"cQHSq1fb63","name":"When You Say Nothing at All","artist":"btj0f116e"},{"id":"clq9Oe2312","name":"Florence","artist":"7gf58ca2"},{"id":"d5yVV2d1bf","name":"Sabra Girl","artist":"VoEa33b3"},{"id":"b3v9Qa2674","name":"Sutter's Mill","artist":"Ui8bedd8"},{"id":"xLtD8ub5090","name":"Ring Them Bells","artist":"bgg4117c9"},{"id":"U2tX5009e","name":"The Hard Way","artist":"eaVB4aa09"},{"id":"b11Bp9d91a","name":"When You Say Nothing at All (Live)","artist":"bza3f3488"},{"id":"elsyD2ebca","name":"Le Jardin d'Adonis","artist":"4Ia7d2ac"},{"id":"fE7404189b","name":"Heart Of Glass","artist":"bfnO1264e"},{"id":"xLpofT9d879","name":"The Cave","artist":"dntn37b69"},{"id":"b1v8L9a886","name":"Landslide","artist":"dzmT3fe64"},{"id":"KxDPb847b","name":"All Your Love","artist":"bsJ4ebf8f"}],"albums":[{"id":"zTyQ306e4","name":"Now That I've Found You: A Col...","artist":"btj0f116e"},{"id":"jjMfb2c25","name":"Still Crooked","artist":"7gf58ca2"},{"id":"3YCD372f1","name":"This Side","artist":"VoEa33b3"},{"id":"f4Sg8900f","name":"A Hundred Miles or More: A Col...","artist":"btj0f116e"},{"id":"eLKk817ea","name":"High Country Snows","artist":"Ui8bedd8"},{"id":"jH0yd088d","name":"Secrets","artist":"eaVB4aa09"},{"id":"jdYL97732","name":"Intuite","artist":"4Ia7d2ac"},{"id":"kpwpabedb","name":"Follow Me Down","artist":"bgg4117c9"},{"id":"9cA03f847","name":"Sigh No More","artist":"dntn37b69"},{"id":"wzpX2901b","name":"Essential Alison Krauss","artist":"btj0f116e"},{"id":"bnkyd9a44","name":"Live","artist":"bza3f3488"},{"id":"f7gC6de01","name":"Six Years","artist":"bfnO1264e"}],"artists":[{"id":"btj0f116e","name":"Alison Krauss"},{"id":"7gf58ca2","name":"Crooked Still"},{"id":"VoEa33b3","name":"Nickel Creek"},{"id":"baADb82a4","name":"Victor Wooten"},{"id":"4Ia7d2ac","name":"Pierre Bensusan"},{"id":"dzmT3fe64","name":"Dixie Chicks"},{"id":"cZm1391d4","name":"Vince Gill"},{"id":"cF4C2dd34","name":"Butch Baldassari"},{"id":"mDFBqo930c7","name":"Chris Stapleton"},{"id":"b2VWffff8","name":"Alecia Nugent"},{"id":"eaVB4aa09","name":"Sierra Hull"},{"id":"3ih8a149","name":"Bill Monroe"}]},{"type":"style","id":"466","name":"另类乡村 Alt-Country","description":"另类乡村音乐\n　　乡村摇滚乐的当代衍生物，强调嘈杂的电吉他，这使它更接近于摇滚乐而不是乡村乐。这个逐渐兴起的运动的名称\"No Depression\"来源于Carter Family的一首歌，高举着自由自足的旗帜，而他们的唱片亦是由一些独立的小厂牌所出版。Uncle Tupelo（现已逝）和The Jayhawks是这个运动的先锋人物，现今的Son Volt，Wilco和Golden Smog则将其推至高潮。\n\nAlternative Country refers to country bands that play traditional country but bend the rules slightly.

Either it is folk songs with large, sweeping pop arrangements, or pop songs with intimate, acoustic-based folk arrangements. Folk-pop began to evolve in the early '60s, but it came into full force after folk-rock became a sensation in the mid-'60s. Folk-pop doesn't have ringing guitars and rougher edges of folk-rock; instead, it is softer, gentler, and more pop-oriented.","songs":[{"id":"xLoKq29df02","name":"Take Me Home Country Roads","artist":"SFzb104c"},{"id":"emIcI33530","name":"Forever at Your Feet","artist":"WuXcb4e9"},{"id":"OMZ5622d8","name":"Last Christmas","artist":"6iJ73478"},{"id":"b2OZm9c604","name":"Overtime","artist":"3ir5ee6c"},{"id":"xLtD8ub5090","name":"Ring Them Bells","artist":"bgg4117c9"},{"id":"xLu1EWa73b1","name":"No One But You","artist":"bEKS1b543"},{"id":"b9Ruidac06","name":"Can't Behave","artist":"EnF77752"},{"id":"U2tX5009e","name":"The Hard Way","artist":"eaVB4aa09"},{"id":"cR8pi246ec","name":"On a Bad Day","artist":"7NX95b68"},{"id":"xLsML3b77c9","name":"All the Stars","artist":"cMxu314a4"},{"id":"MevD6d076","name":"Sylvia Hotel","artist":"VrGbb338"},{"id":"mQOdll54897","name":"Sedona","artist":"cjv9hj59bc3"}],"albums":[{"id":"fDk0659b4","name":"The Country Roads Collection","artist":"SFzb104c"},{"id":"4fWE3c087","name":"Sleepy Little Sailor","artist":"WuXcb4e9"},{"id":"4fwe5bcaa","name":"The Taylor Swift Holiday Colle...","artist":"6iJ73478"},{"id":"NwN5ef63","name":"It Always Will Be","artist":"3ir5ee6c"},{"id":"jExSc24f1","name":"Traveling Light","artist":"EnF77752"},{"id":"5s7v3817f","name":"Constant Companion","artist":"bEKS1b543"},{"id":"jH0yd088d","name":"Secrets","artist":"eaVB4aa09"},{"id":"kpwpabedb","name":"Follow Me Down","artist":"bgg4117c9"},{"id":"c7i7Nxf6fbc","name":"Little Neon Limelight","artist":"cjv9hj59bc3"},{"id":"eMRS7c6fd","name":"Sylvia Hotel","artist":"VrGbb338"},{"id":"kkIccc2d6","name":"Bright Morning Stars","artist":"cMxu314a4"},{"id":"fafp86b34","name":"Barricades & Brickwalls","artist":"7NX95b68"}],"artists":[{"id":"SFzb104c","name":"John Denver"},{"id":"WuXcb4e9","name":"Oh Susanna"},{"id":"bwhme8e7d","name":"赵牧阳"},{"id":"MmF7fb3a","name":"The Civil Wars"},{"id":"Tjydbfdb","name":"Dolly Parton"},{"id":"EnF77752","name":"Courtney Jaye"},{"id":"yfMIpba95b3","name":"Philippa Hanna"},{"id":"3fy6ba23","name":"Hoyt Axton"},{"id":"TgLbfc68","name":"Mary Chapin Carpenter"},{"id":"cnyP2b500","name":"Sugarland"},{"id":"rpBa1e346","name":"Jackson Wells"},{"id":"5qH5bb4f","name":"Carrie Newcomer"}]},{"type":"style","id":"486","name":"前卫乡村 Progressive Country","description":"乡村音乐(country)由早期美洲的开拓者们代代相传直到今天。最早的欧洲移民在北美东海岸登陆后，就以小聚居的团体形式开始慢慢地向美洲大陆腹地推进。当他们来到阿巴拉契亚山脉脚下时，偏远宁静的原野和绿荫覆盖的山峦唤起了他们对家乡的无限思念。于是，许多人便在田纳西州、阿肯色州东北部和肯塔基州西部定居下来。在很长一段时间，这些地区一直没有修建道路，所谓的“交通”只不过是大篷车在荒野上压出的车辙和蜿蜒曲折的河流。虽然闭塞的环境阻碍了经济的发展，但也带来了平静的田园生活。由于这些地区一直处于与世隔绝的封闭状态，很少有什么人和事来打扰他们，几百年来，这些乡民们的生活几乎没有什么变化。\n　　每天傍晚这些乡民总会举行劳作之余的乡间小聚——这是他们主要的文化活动。19世纪20年代，当纽约那些所谓的“都市文明人”正沉迷于爵士乐的浅吟低唱时，这些偏僻地区的乡民们却仍然弹着自制的乐器，吟唱着他们的祖先早年从欧洲大陆带来的古老歌曲。虽然乡间生活的大部分时间总是充满艰辛坎坷，但这些生性无所畏惧的欧陆移民，却始终十分开朗乐观。在宽泛的文化体系影响下，这些民歌无论是曲调还是歌词都十分自由，渐渐形成了美式性格的开朗奔放。伴随着乡间舞蹈，这些简单质朴的民歌渐渐发展起来。就这样，美洲大陆移植了这些传唱了几个世纪之久的欧洲民歌——而这种乡间小唱正是乡村音乐的前身。\n　　实际上，我们通常所说的乡村音乐，在严格的意义上只是乡村音乐中的冰山一角——现代乡村音乐，而真正的乡村音乐本身是个非常庞大的概念。像所有美国流行音乐一样，乡村音乐最初的起源也是多方面的：l9世纪欧洲的民间歌谣、非洲黑人歌曲以及南方的宗教音乐都给了乡村音乐很多养分。正是在这些音乐基础上，乡村音乐历经岁月洗礼，通过无数人的不断发展，才成为最有特色的美国本土音乐之一。\n\nProgressive Country developed in the late '60s as a reaction to the increasingly polished and pop-oriented sound of mainstream, Nashville-based country. Inspired equally by the spare, twangy, hard-driving sound of Bakersfield country, the singer/songwriter introspection of Bob Dylan, classic honky tonk, and rock & roll, progressive country was the first anti-Nashville movement to emerge since the dawn of rock & roll. Progressive country was rootsier and more intellectual than many of its contemporary genres; it was more concerned with breaking boundaries than with scoring hits. The genre was also songwriter-based. Many of its key artists — Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Billy Joe Shaver, Tom T. Hall, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Butch Hancock — were not \"good\" singers by conventional standards, yet they wrote distinctive, individual songs and had compelling voices. By the early '70s, such artists had developed a sizable cult following, and progressive country began to inch its way into the mainstream, usually in the form of cover versions (Sammi Smith took Kristofferson's \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\" to the country Top Ten). Progressive country also provided the basis for outlaw country, a harder-edged genre that shook country-pop (briefly) off the top of the charts in the mid-'70s. Even after Outlaw's five-year reign in the late '70s, progressive country continued to exist, until it eventually metamorphosed into alternative country in the '80s.","songs":[{"id":"b2OZm9c604","name":"Overtime","artist":"3ir5ee6c"},{"id":"fBogi42231","name":"What If She's an Angel","artist":"dg6A3626a"},{"id":"LuHn66f9a","name":"Unchained Melody","artist":"Thc1f9f1"},{"id":"xLquBraffb7","name":"When You Say Nothing At All","artist":"btl8e6276"},{"id":"b11KL15bbb","name":"For the Good Times","artist":"bJkv23bea"},{"id":"mQ6Ia169078","name":"You Are My Sunshine","artist":"2Hr5dd5d"},{"id":"KQVb772c9","name":"Together Again","artist":"cZmF3a8ad"},{"id":"8GbTCce6c79","name":"Short Trip Home (Instrumental)","artist":"bdNSd65dd"},{"id":"b1BUL32c69","name":"Don't Cheat in Our Hometown","artist":"3jf8ac23"},{"id":"b1pM4FM41662","name":"I Walk The Line","artist":"cjj825adc"},{"id":"bBac012063","name":"Amanda","artist":"cjlf27019"},{"id":"b0ISOa30e0","name":"My Infinite Love","artist":"Tkoac5a3"}],"albums":[{"id":"NwN5ef63","name":"It Always Will Be","artist":"3ir5ee6c"},{"id":"jyez104d4","name":"Then Came the Night","artist":"dg6A3626a"},{"id":"c3z147d45","name":"Always on My Mind","artist":"3ir5ee6c"},{"id":"bCH5ed171","name":"Unchained/Son of the South: Pl...","artist":"Thc1f9f1"},{"id":"jX9Zd9607","name":"Greatest Hits","artist":"btl8e6276"},{"id":"bDbSeb4ec","name":"Elite Hotel","artist":"cZmF3a8ad"},{"id":"fSBn78205","name":"Mean Old Man","artist":"2Hr5dd5d"},{"id":"jaqnc9737","name":"Amigo","artist":"5lQ889e0"},{"id":"NjO74480","name":"The Austin Sessions","artist":"bJkv23bea"},{"id":"ccDt1f56e","name":"At Folsom Prison","artist":"cjj825adc"},{"id":"bnIy97baa","name":"Don't Cheat in Our Hometown","artist":"3jf8ac23"},{"id":"bDyD1b4d1","name":"Countryman","artist":"3ir5ee6c"}],"artists":[{"id":"3ir5ee6c","name":"Willie Nelson"},{"id":"Tjydbfdb","name":"Dolly Parton"},{"id":"cZmF3a8ad","name":"Emmylou Harris"},{"id":"bJkv23bea","name":"Kris Kristofferson"},{"id":"dg6A3626a","name":"Tommy Shane Steiner"},{"id":"cjlf27019","name":"Waylon Jennings"},{"id":"3j7ecb26","name":"Tanya Tucker"},{"id":"UhRda606","name":"Townes Van Zandt"},{"id":"5lQ889e0","name":"David Ball"},{"id":"TmDa3d23","name":"Delbert McClinton"},{"id":"Vn9a918e","name":"Allison Moorer"},{"id":"3j38df1b","name":"Randy Travis"}]},{"type":"style","id":"467","name":"美式乡村 Americana","description":"早期商业操作的乡村音乐是与美国南部18、19世纪大不列颠移民带来的传统民歌谣一脉相承的。但早期乡村乐并不坚持口头叙事的传统，而是经常用小提琴这种乐器奏出旋律，代替人声的作用。乡村音乐家John Carson把这两种传统结合了起来，在1923年他的\"78\"这首歌中既演唱又演奏，被认为是早期乡村乐的第一首畅销单曲。\n\n这一时期最负盛名的组合无疑是The Carter Family（卡特家族）----他们对乡村音乐发展的重要性怎么描述都不为过。他们是南部民谣传统的坚守者。他们被认为是\"乡村第一家\"（The First Family of Country Music），他们的那首歌《Will the Circle Be Unbroken》就象\"野花\"《Wildwood Flower》一样是乡村音乐的典范，并第一次把Maybelle Carter的极富感染力的吉他风格介绍给人们。The Stoneman of Galax，Virginia也是早期乡村乐的先驱者。\n\nJimmie Rodgers，\"乡村音乐之父\"。他把大众对乡村音乐的接受度提高到一个新的水平，并且是流行音乐史上最具影响力的歌手之一。他那独一无二的嗓音和为潦倒者写的歌词给它带来了全国性的知名度。由此，他为乡村乐打下了一个崭新的牢固的基础。他在那短暂的录音生涯（1927-33年）的原创，他的歌唱和写曲风格.\nMuch like its next of kin (alternative country-rock), Americana developed during the 1990s as a roots-oriented reaction to the slick commercial sounds that dominated mainstream country during the decade.

This tradition continued to inform country & western music long after its attendant lifestyle had all but disappeared, since romanticized cowboy mythology still held a fascination for many. That fascination resulted in the production of innumerable Western and cowboy films, and with those films came a revival of interest in cowboy music. Actually, it wasn't so much a revival as a hunger for more mythology -- singer/actors like Roy Rogers and Gene Autry relied far more on new compositions which evoked similar themes of cowboy life. The performances and production of cowboy songs depend largely on the context -- while movie songs were usually recorded with modern soundtrack-style orchestras, old-time groups like the Sons of the Pioneers relied on traditional, unadorned acoustic instruments. While it's the spirit of cowboy music, rather than specific standard songs, that has generally survived in country music, some artists have sought to preserve the tradition and educate their audiences about authentic cowboy songs; Michael Martin Murphey became a notable figure in these efforts during the '90s.","songs":[{"id":"bf0uoJB34052","name":"Jingle Bells ","artist":"Ti0b5305"},{"id":"ejWHa30cdc","name":"Look at You Girl","artist":"dbrR389fd"},{"id":"8GtQTyed9b2","name":"流れ行く雲","artist":"b1wdsF7676a"},{"id":"cjKCte68bf","name":"Ship My Body Back to Texas","artist":"VsRc7c1f"},{"id":"ek8bG3162b","name":"Red River Valley","artist":"3io86883"},{"id":"b0Zkf12dd6","name":"Back in the Saddle Again","artist":"c9ns3334b"},{"id":"eQTWG35d2d","name":"Big Iron","artist":"3iR4c703"},{"id":"mQ4e2U801b3","name":"Heart of Life","artist":"bhcdc6681"},{"id":"8Gfzgheed2e","name":"Main Title","artist":"DgR8eb6c"},{"id":"LHAl832f0","name":"Blossoms in the Springtime","artist":"Tkda9663"},{"id":"xLCqwia404b","name":"FakeSing","artist":"X7yd0650"},{"id":"b1pUNa5324","name":"Wanted Man","artist":"cjj825adc"}],"albums":[{"id":"eNY183561","name":"Used to Want to Be a Cowboy","artist":"dbrR389fd"},{"id":"eNY991b4c","name":"Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy","artist":"dbrR389fd"},{"id":"oda2f713a","name":"Angels & Outlaws","artist":"bhcdc6681"},{"id":"c3xI2946e","name":"Cowboy Songs","artist":"3io86883"},{"id":"mTXeMBc825c","name":"Cover","artist":"b1wdsF7676a"},{"id":"3YQV34c45","name":"After the Storm","artist":"dbrR389fd"},{"id":"NB37d16c","name":"Gunfighter Ballads and Trail S...","artist":"3iR4c703"},{"id":"CvIQ48ff8","name":"West by Southwest","artist":"VsRc7c1f"},{"id":"fxPN985d7","name":"High Noon","artist":"DgR8eb6c"},{"id":"yY0X5f7092","name":"Under Western Skies","artist":"3iR4c703"},{"id":"cTED2ed1f","name":"Cowboy Songs","artist":"c9ns3334b"},{"id":"NJn699a9","name":"Just Keep A-Movin'","artist":"Tkda9663"}],"artists":[{"id":"cjj825adc","name":"Johnny Cash"},{"id":"btlpf74d6","name":"Floyd Tillman"},{"id":"TjJd1c6b","name":"Tex Ritter"},{"id":"3ir5ee6c","name":"Willie Nelson"},{"id":"btlBe2c77","name":"Don Williams"},{"id":"dzlG61c0c","name":"Chet Atkins"},{"id":"TkIbfce0","name":"Hank Williams"},{"id":"2Hr5dd5d","name":"Jerry Lee Lewis"},{"id":"c8Le32d9a","name":"Wanda Jackson"},{"id":"Tjydbfdb","name":"Dolly Parton"},{"id":"Tj914a97","name":"Jim Reeves"},{"id":"TkKd0587","name":"Tex Williams"}]},{"type":"style","id":"1285","name":"传统乡村 Traditional Country","description":"乡村音乐诞生于1920年，Jimmie Rodgers将多种音乐风格混合，Dalhart的流行乐风格。正是界于这些之间文化--乡村音乐。\n　　他们的才能得助于当时的时代气息：如果大量的无线电和录音产品被弃之一边，美国风格的音乐就会被禁锢起来，无法得以传播，而乡村音乐也就无法在20年代得以创造出来了。\n　　Dalhart也许已为大多数人所遗忘，但他却是乡村音乐真正的第一位大明星。\n　　出生于德克萨斯州东部Marion Try Slaughter的一个牧牛家庭的他，在1910年来到了纽约，找到了一份在葬礼上唱歌的工作。然后，他参加了轻歌剧的表演。他的录音生涯始与1924年他的\"囚徒之歌\"（\"The Prisoner's Song\"）及其B面的\"97遗骸\"（\"The Wreck of the Old 97\"）的发售。他的用特有的方式演唱南部山区的歌曲，赢得了大众的欢迎，并使其成为在乡村音乐史中第一个获得百万销量的歌手。\n　　为了寻求更大的成功，录音公司开始向南部派出星探。Victor录音公司的Ralph Peer发现了Jimmy Rodgers和Carter家族，在1927年分别为他们在Bristol和Va录了音。\"这些录音在乡村音乐的历史上独具重要性。\"资深乡村艺人JohnnyCash这样说。Rodgers和Carter家族包括了A.

The era of traditional country didn't begin until the late '20s, when Jimmie Rodgers became the first national country music star. Rodgers brought the formerly rural music into the industrial era by streamlining the music and lyrics; in the process, he made the genre a viable commercial property. Following Rodgers' success, old-time music faded in popularity and traditional country was born. For the next 40 years, most country music fell under the traditional country umbrella, regardless if it was the big-band dance music of Western swing or driving roadhouse honky tonk. The majority of the popular artists from the '30s and '40s — Acuff, Eddy Arnold, Ernest Tubb, Hank Williams — became the foundation of the Grand Ole Opry, a weekly radio broadcast that became the definitive word of country music. This generation of musicians inspired all the artists that emerged in the following two decades, who put their own spin on traditional country. Following the emergence of rock & roll, country music began to incorporate more pop production techniques, and although this Nashville sound was smoother than the music of the '40s and early '50s, it still conformed to the conventions of traditional country. During the '60s, mainstream country became progressively more pop-influenced, yet traditional country held strong until the early '70s, when country-pop became the dominant form of country music. Many fans of hard country turned toward the tougher sounds of progressive country and outlaw country, yet most of the country audience continued to listen to country-pop, especially since traditional country singers like George Jones, Conway Twitty, and Loretta Lynn had turned toward that subgenre. By the late '70s, most new country singers were either raised on country-pop or pop/rock, and consequently, the reign of traditional country came to an end. During the mid-'80s, a wave of new-traditionalist singers such as George Strait emerged, but their music tended to be influenced by contemporaries as well, making the movement as much an evolution as a revival.","songs":[{"id":"chnW7f704f","name":"Hurt","artist":"cjj825adc"},{"id":"bf0uoJB34052","name":"Jingle Bells ","artist":"Ti0b5305"},{"id":"mQ3kid68019","name":"Jambalaya (On The Bayou)","artist":"TkIbfce0"},{"id":"b06uJd60c1","name":"We Got Love","artist":"btlBe2c77"},{"id":"mQGtFQ91c51","name":"Bring You Back","artist":"N9S5dcd4"},{"id":"b0MZGa68e6","name":"Jingle Bells","artist":"3hm84c67"},{"id":"b1T9Ad109e","name":"Keep on the Sunny Side","artist":"clta2836b"},{"id":"xL0E3Ob7878","name":"That's How I Got To Memphis","artist":"3f28bbce"},{"id":"L3596e1eb","name":"Love Bug","artist":"Ti0b5305"},{"id":"bBac012063","name":"Amanda","artist":"cjlf27019"},{"id":"cXj4i23fae","name":"I Will Always Love You","artist":"Tjydbfdb"},{"id":"xL3HYcd9df4","name":"You Are My Sunshine","artist":"3gz8ecf1"}],"albums":[{"id":"bCDCf9ebe","name":"American IV: The Man Comes Aro...","artist":"cjj825adc"},{"id":"gbsr76e1f","name":"Unearthed","artist":"cjj825adc"},{"id":"gjWB4f4c6","name":"The Definitive Collection","artist":"btlBe2c77"},{"id":"bEcRf80ee","name":"New Moves","artist":"btlBe2c77"},{"id":"8Xo0417f6","name":"The Complete Hank Williams","artist":"9dgVREefa39"},{"id":"yhixkwd1c94","name":"Reflections","artist":"btlBe2c77"},{"id":"URRrfW2c5f3","name":"Hurt","artist":"cjj825adc"},{"id":"yfV5bFc772f","name":"Bring You Back","artist":"N9S5dcd4"},{"id":"jJQV1672f","name":"40 Greatest Hits","artist":"9dgVREefa39"},{"id":"MBM5277a","name":"American III: Solitary Man","artist":"cjj825adc"},{"id":"jvUMgk3dc74","name":"For the Good Times","artist":"3f28bbce"},{"id":"jKrWcd3b1","name":"16 Biggest Hits","artist":"Tjydbfdb"}],"artists":[{"id":"cjj825adc","name":"Johnny Cash"},{"id":"btlpf74d6","name":"Floyd Tillman"},{"id":"3ir5ee6c","name":"Willie Nelson"},{"id":"btlBe2c77","name":"Don Williams"},{"id":"dzlG61c0c","name":"Chet Atkins"},{"id":"TkIbfce0","name":"Hank Williams"},{"id":"Tjydbfdb","name":"Dolly Parton"},{"id":"cZmF3a8ad","name":"Emmylou Harris"},{"id":"3gg81071","name":"Patsy Cline"},{"id":"3hm84c67","name":"Merle Haggard"},{"id":"dPqgbb37f","name":"Jimmie Rodgers"},{"id":"cjlf27019","name":"Waylon Jennings"}]},{"type":"style","id":"490","name":"传统蓝草 Traditional Bluegrass","description":"蓝草音乐（Bluegrass）是美国民谣音乐的一种，同时也是乡村音乐的分支。它在爱尔兰、苏格兰、英格兰的传统音乐分别有不同的来源。蓝草音乐的灵感来自于英国与爱尔兰、尤其是苏格兰阿巴拉契亚的新移民，和爵士乐与蓝调一样。相对于传统音乐里，所有乐器同时演奏，或某项乐器做主角、其他乐器负责配乐的演奏模式，在蓝草音乐里，就像爵士乐，每项乐器都有机会独奏，或是在其他乐器的伴奏下即兴演奏。典型的传统蓝草音乐，是以弦乐器为基础，像是曼陀林、空心吉他、班卓琴、小提琴、直立式贝斯等，也可以再配上歌声。\n\nBluegrass music grew out of traditional string band music that formed the roots of country music. In the '40s, country music began to splinter into different directions, as honky tonk and country-pop became genres of their own. A certain segment of country musicians continued playing traditional string music. Led by Bill Monroe, these musicians adhered to the songs, structures, and conventions of string bands, but they made the music faster, harder, and more technically demanding. The result was bluegrass; the genre was named after Bill Monroe's backing band, the Blue Grass Boys. After its inception in the mid-'40s, bluegrass didn't change for nearly 20 years. In the late '60s, a number of bluegrass groups began expanding the possibilities of the genre, much to the chagrin of many of the music's most popular artists and dedicated fans. Consequently, the new breed of bluegrass groups were dubbed progressive bluegrass while those that adhered to the music's heritage were tagged Traditional Bluegrass. Over the next three decades, progressive bluegrass changed frequently, while the sound of traditional bluegrass never varied.","songs":[{"id":"LrI37af25","name":"Chadin' Rainbows","artist":"3f87f018"},{"id":"ci2XB1a6a3","name":"Just Loving You","artist":"TiAb1865"},{"id":"KIjR72e87","name":"Worried Man Blues","artist":"3jp6ebe9"},{"id":"d2P9M29da2","name":"Streets of London","artist":"cZok361ce"},{"id":"cgHiwea01a","name":"Grandfather's Clock","artist":"Tifa62e4"},{"id":"KDwqa0f82","name":"Great Judgement Morning","artist":"btlGe57c6"},{"id":"VhGo75a04","name":"Waltz for Mr. B","artist":"dPmV48f81"},{"id":"xLsvBD12c4f","name":"Interlude","artist":"LEx9619e"},{"id":"xLpPKba580f","name":"When Somebody Loved Me ","artist":"zDL52f003"},{"id":"b1vMdc7ddd","name":"Turkey in the Straw","artist":"3gD7f862"},{"id":"bAKnuc2c66","name":"Angeline","artist":"5nM4dbb9"},{"id":"bBlI896a6f","name":"Meager Hero","artist":"bvsKff46e"}],"albums":[{"id":"NN78ead4","name":"A   Distant Land to Roam: Song...","artist":"3jp6ebe9"},{"id":"bC6Tf4067","name":"Blake & Rice","artist":"3f87f018"},{"id":"MXG7d991","name":"Tone Poems","artist":"Tifa62e4"},{"id":"NkK55409","name":"More Behind the Picture Than t...","artist":"TiAb1865"},{"id":"dIB843559","name":"Flower From the Fields of Alab...","artist":"3f87f018"},{"id":"bn9Uc6da0","name":"Church Street Blues","artist":"cZok361ce"},{"id":"jLpJdbecc","name":"Music du Jour","artist":"bvsKff46e"},{"id":"ogZPf1fd8","name":"O Mickey, Where Art Thou?","artist":"c2bW2c384"},{"id":"bDADf4133","name":"California Autumn","artist":"cZok361ce"},{"id":"jJd3a60a7","name":"Inside Out","artist":"5nM4dbb9"},{"id":"s6Bx218e9","name":"Good Southern Girl","artist":"LEx9619e"},{"id":"OdQ563c9","name":"15 of My Grandma's Favorites","artist":"btlGe57c6"}],"artists":[{"id":"3f0856f3","name":"Kenny Baker"},{"id":"cF4C2dd34","name":"Butch Baldassari"},{"id":"3ih8a149","name":"Bill Monroe"},{"id":"5lK78c3b","name":"Dan Tyminski"},{"id":"TiAb1865","name":"Doyle Lawson"},{"id":"3f87f018","name":"Norman Blake"},{"id":"TjSd14d0","name":"Earl Scruggs"},{"id":"Tifa62e4","name":"David Grisman"},{"id":"cZok361ce","name":"Tony Rice"},{"id":"3jf8ac23","name":"Ricky Skaggs"},{"id":"3jp6ebe9","name":"Ralph Stanley"},{"id":"5ql5fee2","name":"Steve Martin"}]},{"type":"style","id":"497","name":"乡村福音 Country Gospel","description":"基督徒音乐 (有时销售作为激动人心的音乐，称赞音乐， 崇拜音乐或者 当代基督徒音乐/CCM)是被写表达个人或共同信仰关于基督徒生活的音乐，并且(根据变化的音乐样式)到授予每基督徒选择到主流世俗的音乐。\n\n象其他形式 音乐 创作、表现、意义和基督徒音乐的甚而定义根据文化和社会环境变化。 基督徒音乐为许多目的组成并且执行，排列从审美乐趣，宗教或者礼仪目的，或者作为娱乐产品为市场。 然而，多数基督徒音乐一个共同主题是称赞、崇拜和感谢对上帝。\n\n风格和subgenres\n\n基督徒音乐可以被划分成几种风格和次级风格，虽然音乐风格之间的分界线和关系经常是微妙，有时开放到单独解释和偶尔地有争议的。 这些风格(有时指‘样式’)象音乐的其他形式也许靠技术区别、样式、上下文和题材或者地理起源。 历史的类别和风格包括(但没有被限制) ： 赞美诗, Motets, 序列, 唱赞美诗, 轮唱, 当代基督徒音乐, 南部的福音书和 都市当代福音书. 基督徒音乐具体subgenres也许包括(但没有被限制) ： 进步南部的福音书, 基督徒乡村音乐, 基督徒流行音乐, 基督徒岩石, 基督徒金属 (包括 基督徒metalcore), 基督徒废物, 基督徒供选择的岩石, 基督徒Hip Hop (包括 基督徒斥责), 周年纪念四重唱和许多唱诗班音乐。\n\n\n圣经的基础为基督徒音乐在崇拜\n\n基督徒音乐在称赞和崇拜有它的根在圣经的旧约。 称赞是崇拜的一个重要部分在提供信徒机会的许多基督教会里表达他们的喜悦和谢意对上帝。 其中一个崇拜表示的最重要的目的在犹太和基督徒信念是称赞上帝。\n\n诗篇集在旧约在犹太教和基督教提供称赞和崇拜许多章节和经常被背诵以各种各样的形式。 诗篇集包括五本不同“书”祷告和称赞。 大卫，认为是赞美诗的部分的作者，是合并称赞和崇拜到寺庙崇拜里的竖琴家和作曲家。\n\n七个不同场合词组“在赞美诗的国王詹姆斯・ Version弄出快乐的声响”被找到。 诗篇集通过拍手鼓励崇拜，演奏各种各样的乐器，呼喊和唱歌。 “O来，让我们崇拜，并且压垮，让我们在我们的制作商”的阁下之前下跪(赞美诗95.6，詹姆斯・ Version)国王是显示谦逊的态度的段落是重要的在上帝崇拜。 其中一个被认可的段落是赞美诗100以它“服务阁下的敦促以高兴; 在他的存在之前来以唱歌。“他的人是“输入他的门以感恩和到他的法院里以称赞”。\n\n虽然一些基督教会不相信崇拜用乐器，多数犹太寺庙和犹太教堂以及基督教会在他们的崇拜使用各种各样的类型的仪器。 唱歌经常是崇拜经验的部分。\n\n\n表现\n\n它执行的基督徒音乐也许也被分类根据设置。 最传统的方式将听见基督徒音乐是活，在，或者作为其中一位音乐家面前在崇拜或宗教设置。\n\n\n崇拜服务\n\n基督徒音乐最流行的表现在宗教或崇拜服务。 这在星期天早晨传统上做了在教堂，然而它也许通过一个教会做在星期的其他天和晚上或在其他地点，例如咖啡馆、音乐厅、校园，甚至酒吧。 表现音乐的具体形式包括(但没有被限制) ： 礼拜仪式的音乐, 大量(音乐)或者 崇拜服务. 这样表现也许包括a 崇拜领导, 唱诗班崇拜带，并且/或者 崇拜介绍节目.\n\n\n音乐节&会议\n\n很多个基督徒 音乐节 被组织了。 第一个是 Ichthus音乐节 哪些1970年开始的和最大部分是 基石节日 并且 创作节日 哪些可以画向上100,000个人。 他们是共同的在夏令时并且画许多另外人，具体地那些从组织的小组例如教会 青年小组 并且校园小组。 除音乐节之外喜欢是一部分的那些 基督徒节日协会也有许多基督徒 会议 更哪个焦点在报告人，但通常也把演奏，特别是为a 崇拜服务.\n\n\n音乐会\n\n象所有乐团或行动，许多基督徒音乐艺术家执行音乐会 音乐厅酒吧&俱乐部，室外地点，或者，无论哪里一位世俗音乐家也许演奏。 有时它也许是在前面纯净的娱乐，其他次打算 改变信仰 或目击的和其他时间也许作为部分 崇拜 。\n\n\n媒介\n\n今天基督徒音乐通过多数可利用的媒介是可利用的。 基督徒音乐是广播在收音机、电视或者互联网。 基督徒册页和录影记录(CD, LP, 数字式下载, DVD等等)是越来越更加普遍的和继续了到销售增加。\n\nAlong with old-time, Country Gospel is the oldest genre in country music. Though it somewhat changed with the times, country gospel remained the most simple and straightforward of all country subgenres. The sound of country gospel is similar to traditional country -- the only difference is, the subject matter is religious, not secular. Like traditional country, the sound of country gospel became smoother and more pop-oriented as the decades progressed, and by the early '70s, it became nearly indistinguishable from the lush sounds of mainstream pop. That trend continued throughout the rest of the '70s and '80s, and by the '90s, contemporary country gospel sounded identical to the adult contemporary inclinations of CCM. Nevertheless, that music was never widely recognized as country gospel, which will always be identified with its simple arrangements, small vocal choirs, and twangy instrumentation.","songs":[{"id":"bf0uoJB34052","name":"Jingle Bells ","artist":"Ti0b5305"},{"id":"L16C8686a","name":"What a Friend We Have in Jesus","artist":"3h0810ff"},{"id":"mQ5gpZ6208c","name":"I Don't Hurt Anymore","artist":"cjj825adc"},{"id":"Lol07a0b9","name":"Blue Christmas","artist":"SKia1094"},{"id":"N8WR6cbd8","name":"I Will Be Here","artist":"VtM9ba92"},{"id":"VvMM4dfcd","name":"Nashville Cats","artist":"dPpo43fca"},{"id":"dDejV29f76","name":"Precious Memories","artist":"cjlD2b3e4"},{"id":"LxIm887e3","name":"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms","artist":"btis16de6"},{"id":"NQjX8d08f","name":"There But for the Grace of God Go I","artist":"dRtX46508"},{"id":"U5RC3Y27d74","name":"Sixteen Tons","artist":"ThLd1184"},{"id":"xLzvQxc77a3","name":"Amazing Grace","artist":"TjNc7f86"},{"id":"LnF08a72c","name":"Amazing Grace","artist":"Tghe07d5"}],"albums":[{"id":"bneEdcf00","name":"Precious Memories","artist":"3h0810ff"},{"id":"jWoEc7f47","name":"American VI: Ain't No Grave","artist":"cjj825adc"},{"id":"bftlzyl31179","name":"Precious Memories Volume II","artist":"3h0810ff"},{"id":"beCCbf2f0","name":"Elvis' Christmas Album","artist":"SKia1094"},{"id":"4RgY352a9","name":"Beauty Will Rise","artist":"VtM9ba92"},{"id":"bmCOde101","name":"My Mother's Hymn Book","artist":"cjj825adc"},{"id":"wvHt264a2","name":"Classic Country Hymns","artist":"cjlD2b3e4"},{"id":"iY7ibc5af","name":"Speechless","artist":"VtM9ba92"},{"id":"083L51437","name":"By Request","artist":"dPpo43fca"},{"id":"lcCsK7a5a2","name":"Deep Roots","artist":"VtM9ba92"},{"id":"dtMu38761","name":"Everybody's Brother","artist":"bJlK1f503"},{"id":"jWMEce373","name":"The Great Lost Performance","artist":"cjj825adc"}],"artists":[{"id":"cjj825adc","name":"Johnny Cash"},{"id":"3g179449","name":"Skeeter Davis"},{"id":"c8Le32d9a","name":"Wanda Jackson"},{"id":"Ti0b5305","name":"George Jones"},{"id":"TiAb1865","name":"Doyle Lawson"},{"id":"VtM9ba92","name":"Steven Curtis Chapman"},{"id":"3j38df1b","name":"Randy Travis"},{"id":"Tk5add1e","name":"Porter Wagoner"},{"id":"3j995ecb","name":"Conway Twitty"},{"id":"Tkk103a3","name":"The Statler Brothers"},{"id":"ThLd1184","name":"Tennessee Ernie Ford"},{"id":"3i96f8fd","name":"Ray Price"}]},{"type":"style","id":"474","name":"纳什维尔之声 Nashville Sound","description":"纳什维尔之声是1950年代乡村音乐的别称，主要盛行于田纳西州的纳什维尔。从音乐风格上看，它介于乡村音乐和流行音乐之间，既具有乡村音乐的乡土特色，同时也带有流行音乐的时代气息。具体来看，纳什维尔之声主要以钢琴、弦乐和背景合音来作为音乐基础，它与传统的提琴、班卓琴伴奏的乡村音乐有所不同，比传统乡村音乐显得更加流行化，更具盛业气息。\n\nCountrypolitan — an outgrowth of the Nashville sound of the '50s — is among the most commercially-oriented genres of country music. The Nashville sound emerged in the '50s as a way to bring country music to a broad pop audience. The movement was led by Chet Atkins, who was the head of RCA Records' country division. Atkins designed a smooth, commercial sound that relied on country song structures but abandoned all of the hillbilly and honky tonk instrumentation. He hired session musicians and coordinated pop-oriented, jazz-tinged productions. Similarly, Owen Bradley created productions — most notably with Patsy Cline — that featured sophisticated productions and smooth, textured instrumentation. Eventually, most records from Nashville featured this style of production and the Nashville sound began to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. In the late '60s, the Nashville sound metamorphosed into countrypolitan, which emphasized these kinds of pop production flourishes. Featuring layers of keyboards, guitars, strings, and vocals, countrypolitan records were designed to cross over to pop radio and they frequently did.

During that decade, many of the most popular hardcore country singers of the '60s — from George Jones to Merle Haggard — softened their sound slightly, moving away from their honky tonk roots. While the outlaws weren't strictly honky tonk — they were as much storytellers in the tradition of folk songwriters as they were honky tonk vocalists — they kept that spirit alive. Outlaws didn't play by Nashville's rules. They didn't change their music to fit the heavily produced, pop-oriented Nashville sound, nor did they go out of their way to fit into the accepted conventions of country music. Instead, they created an edgy form of hardcore country that was influenced by rock & roll, folk, and blues. Ironically, two of the leading figures of the movement — Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson — had their roots in the music industry, but by the time they came into their own as recording artists in the mid-'70s, they had developed a unique, defiant way of performing. Several other musicians — including David Allan Coe, Billy Joe Shaver, and Tompall Glaser — followed in their footsteps, and the outlaws were quite popular for a period of three to four years. At the end of the '70s, the urban cowboy movement easily eclipsed the outlaw movement in terms of commercial appeal, but the outlaws had a lasting influence. During the '80s, certain neo-traditionalists owed a bit of their sound to the outlaws, while a whole breed of songwriters, led by Steve Earle, demonstrated a massive debt to the outlaws and their fusion of country, folk, and rock.","songs":[{"id":"MOXT69605","name":"Always on My Mind","artist":"3ir5ee6c"},{"id":"LuHn66f9a","name":"Unchained Melody","artist":"Thc1f9f1"},{"id":"b11KL15bbb","name":"For the Good Times","artist":"bJkv23bea"},{"id":"mQ6Ia169078","name":"You Are My Sunshine","artist":"2Hr5dd5d"},{"id":"bBac012063","name":"Amanda","artist":"cjlf27019"},{"id":"8G0NWk2e422","name":"It Ain't My Fault","artist":"cWeBwdb154a"},{"id":"8GeCuz1c893","name":"Closing In On The Fire","artist":"SOEc2e7d"},{"id":"ejikP4e225","name":"Starman","artist":"3gk4e9f3"},{"id":"mSLQ3D55526","name":"I Was Jack (You Were Diane)","artist":"bb3vb4e3e"},{"id":"La2C635ed","name":"Rock & Roll Shoes","artist":"btd11cbc4"},{"id":"b1qfqvM423ca","name":"Good Ol' Girl","artist":"bEkYu27b654"},{"id":"NZON77738","name":"Love Me Like a Song","artist":"dbqm3ad16"}],"albums":[{"id":"c3z147d45","name":"Always on My Mind","artist":"3ir5ee6c"},{"id":"bCH5ed171","name":"Unchained/Son of the South: Pl...","artist":"Thc1f9f1"},{"id":"fSBn78205","name":"Mean Old Man","artist":"2Hr5dd5d"},{"id":"cvvn28dab","name":"The Heroines","artist":"SOEc2e7d"},{"id":"NjO74480","name":"The Austin Sessions","artist":"bJkv23bea"},{"id":"cuqN2d1f0","name":"Last Man Standing","artist":"2Hr5dd5d"},{"id":"bqgypzk398e4","name":"Pawn Shop","artist":"cWeBwdb154a"},{"id":"f8iw8d55a","name":"16 Biggest Hits [2005]","artist":"cjlf27019"},{"id":"ejqK4980f","name":"Kristofferson","artist":"bJkv23bea"},{"id":"blAcb36f5","name":"Friendship","artist":"btd11cbc4"},{"id":"vBgU27302","name":"Picture in a Frame","artist":"dbqm3ad16"},{"id":"NvG5580c","name":"Stardust","artist":"3ir5ee6c"}],"artists":[{"id":"3ir5ee6c","name":"Willie Nelson"},{"id":"bJkv23bea","name":"Kris Kristofferson"},{"id":"mDFBqo930c7","name":"Chris Stapleton"},{"id":"cjlf27019","name":"Waylon Jennings"},{"id":"3jP5046a","name":"Hank Williams Jr."},{"id":"3f28bbce","name":"Bobby Bare"},{"id":"TgUce456","name":"Guy Clark"},{"id":"3fs936d2","name":"John Anderson"},{"id":"bJlK1f503","name":"Billy Joe Shaver"},{"id":"Thc1f9f1","name":"David Allan Coe"},{"id":"eeMy47461","name":"Shooter Jennings"},{"id":"bvsqe8bb4","name":"Ray Wylie Hubbard"}]},{"type":"style","id":"485","name":"前卫蓝草 Progressive Bluegrass","description":"由乡村音乐派生而来的音乐流派。最初，它是作为一种乡村音乐继续发展的同时能够保持其纯净性的方法而存在的，后来蓝草发展成为一种具有自己风格与特点的流派。如果说到蓝草产生的原因，那么就是Bill Monroe；这个流派便是以他的乐队命名的(Bluegrass Boys)。Monroe在40年代中期开创了这种流派的标准风格——硬而快的节奏；高而密集的合声；并且显着地强调乐器的作用，后来，他在50年代将此流派普及。到那十年的结尾时，他们的音乐已经成为乡村音乐的一部分，并且，有众多的乐团跟上了他们的脚步。在60年代，像the Dillards这样的乐团让蓝草走得更远，他们在音乐中加入了摇滚和爵士元素并以此创造了蓝草流派的支派——现代蓝草(Progressive Bluegrass)。现代蓝草在接下来的三十年中继续发展，于此同时，传统蓝草继续守卫着蓝草的传统风格。\n\nBluegrass is one of the most rigid music genres, one that steadfastly refuses to change its direction. Therefore, Progressive Bluegrass is viewed with skepticism at best, derision at worst, by some hardcore bluegrass fans. Progressive bluegrass expands the sonic palette of bluegrass either by adding elements of jazz, folk, country, and rock, or by amplifying the instruments. The subgenre developed in the late '60s, but it flourished in the '70s, when bands like the Dillards, Boone Creek, Country Gazette, and New Grass Revival began coming to the forefront of bluegrass and folk festivals. Throughout the '80s and '90s, progressive bluegrass continued to evolve, moving closer toward folk and rock in some quarters and closer to jazz in others.","songs":[{"id":"clq9Oe2312","name":"Florence","artist":"7gf58ca2"},{"id":"d5yVV2d1bf","name":"Sabra Girl","artist":"VoEa33b3"},{"id":"b11Bp9d91a","name":"When You Say Nothing at All (Live)","artist":"bza3f3488"},{"id":"fE7404189b","name":"Heart Of Glass","artist":"bfnO1264e"},{"id":"8GdqdWff0ec","name":"Better Be Home Soon","artist":"bBBy17ef9"},{"id":"d27iZ29121","name":"Young Man's Town","artist":"cZm1391d4"},{"id":"Ve9Z749c0","name":"Will We Go","artist":"b53lf4f4d"},{"id":"8GbTCce6c79","name":"Short Trip Home (Instrumental)","artist":"bdNSd65dd"},{"id":"Lyfp8f228","name":"Wide Open Spaces","artist":"dzmT3fe64"},{"id":"cruI6e34dc","name":"Pretty Flowers","artist":"5ql5fee2"},{"id":"b1BUL32c69","name":"Don't Cheat in Our Hometown","artist":"3jf8ac23"},{"id":"b118J9fccc","name":"Stay","artist":"btj0f116e"}],"albums":[{"id":"jjMfb2c25","name":"Still Crooked","artist":"7gf58ca2"},{"id":"3YCD372f1","name":"This Side","artist":"VoEa33b3"},{"id":"bnkyd9a44","name":"Live","artist":"bza3f3488"},{"id":"f7gC6de01","name":"Six Years","artist":"bfnO1264e"},{"id":"bnkva03d4","name":"So Long So Wrong","artist":"bza3f3488"},{"id":"khZPae719","name":"Love Goes On","artist":"bBBy17ef9"},{"id":"iZT5d560d","name":"Why Should the Fire Die?","artist":"VoEa33b3"},{"id":"bnkwdd0c9","name":"Forget About It","artist":"btj0f116e"},{"id":"bmVX9d064","name":"Next Big Thing","artist":"cZm1391d4"},{"id":"sns120e00","name":"Reasons Why (The Very Best)","artist":"VoEa33b3"},{"id":"c2YC27a31","name":"The Key","artist":"cZm1391d4"},{"id":"nW9Rf8770","name":"Sara Watkins","artist":"b53lf4f4d"}],"artists":[{"id":"btj0f116e","name":"Alison Krauss"},{"id":"7gf58ca2","name":"Crooked Still"},{"id":"VoEa33b3","name":"Nickel Creek"},{"id":"baADb82a4","name":"Victor Wooten"},{"id":"dzmT3fe64","name":"Dixie Chicks"},{"id":"cZm1391d4","name":"Vince Gill"},{"id":"bfnO1264e","name":"Old School Freight Train"},{"id":"SS3db2b4","name":"Béla Fleck"},{"id":"3f87f018","name":"Norman Blake"},{"id":"5nT4ee01","name":"Rhonda Vincent"},{"id":"Tifa62e4","name":"David Grisman"},{"id":"4iy800ba","name":"Jerry Garcia"}]},{"type":"style","id":"496","name":"弦乐团 String Band","description":"现今经常被提到的弦乐一般是指西洋管弦乐队中的弦乐组（小提琴，中提琴，大提琴，低音提琴）。可以合奏的乐器很多，在西洋弦乐方面最常见的是弦乐四重奏（第一小提，第二小提琴，中提琴，大提琴）不过形式也不固定。现在的重奏形式更始层出不穷，木管组（长笛，单簧管，双簧管，巴松）也经常加上圆号组成五重奏。民族器乐中除了传统常见的重奏形式，古筝，琵琶，二胡等都可以加上钢琴来伴奏。\n\nWith their intricate instrumental interplay and driving rhythms, String Bands were the most distinctive subgenre of old time country.

Swing","description":"简介\n\n西部摇摆是乡村乐的一个分支，20世纪30年代，由于美国东南部经济的不景气，使得唱片销量急剧下降，乡村音乐只能通过大量的广播节目而维持它的听众。此时出现了一种现象，原来的演唱组逐渐被个人演唱所替代。如罗伊·阿卡夫（Roy Acuff）、简尼·奥崔（Gene Autry）等人成了这时的焦点人物。在这种背景下，来自德克萨斯的鲍勃·韦尔斯（Bob Wills）在乡村音乐中融入了大量的西部牛仔歌曲（一种来自乡间的浪漫情歌）和摇摆乐的成分，创造了一种类似\"大乐队\"阵容的西部摇摆（Westen Swing）风格。1933年，鲍勃·韦尔斯将这种集合了舞蹈节奏、提琴音色、大乐队阵容、爵士唱法和架子鼓、失真吉它的新型风格成功地推向了市场，从而使其获得了\"西部摇摆之王\"的称号。\n西部摇摆-特色    \n超好听的西部摇摆乐，身体里的每个细胞都会跳动起来，吉它声响起时，觉得自己已变身西部牛仔,骑在马上扬着缰绳，随着轻快的小提琴声，追着牛儿在农场上狂奔。而当Steel Guitar响起时，我就仿佛坐在酒吧前,喝着啤酒,看着窗外西部草原的落日徐徐落下，享受着夜晚来临的恬静。\nAsleep at the Wheel是一支老牌西部摇摆乐队,自1973年出道以来发行了22张专辑,赢得9项格莱美大奖.,是他们2007年的最新专辑。如果你喜欢乡村,如果你喜欢爵士,如果你喜欢摇摆,那你一定不能错过这张专辑。PS西部摇摆是一种产生于美国经济大萧条时期的音乐，诞生在德克萨斯和俄克拉荷马州的脏兮兮的舞厅里，西部摇摆乐把乡村乐的感觉嫁接在复杂的爵士节奏上。采用不同于传统乡村乐而更接近大乐队（Big band）的阵容（一般包括小号）。\n西部摇摆-影响    \n一种经济大萧条时期的音乐，诞生在德克萨斯和俄克拉荷马州的脏兮兮的舞厅里，西部摇摆乐把乡村乐的感觉嫁接在复杂的爵士节奏上。 采用不同于传统乡村乐而更接近大乐队（Big band）的阵容（一般包括小号）。 Bob Wills不久无可争议地夺取了这一音乐类型的王冠。\n 在即兴演奏方面与他的\"德州花花公子\"（The Texas Playboys）乐队在一起他是一个真正的革新者。在任何一个晚上，他都有能力发挥他的同伴和他的最佳状态这在乡村音乐史上产生了深远的影响。其他的西部摇摆乐队包括折中音乐形式的创始人 Milton Brown（以及他的Musical Brownies）和Spade Cooley。 今天，象\"睡在轮边\"（Asleep At The Wheel）这样的乐队还在继续这一乡村音乐传统！ \n\n西部摇摆-背景\n \n在20年代所打下的基础上不断发展下， 30 年代的乡村音乐融入了西部的味道。歌唱牛仔如Gene Autry那样开始风行；在德克萨斯（Texas），颇具创新的bob wills参与创造了一种时尚崭新的舞曲音乐叫作“西部摇摆”（Westen Swing）；而Patsy Montana则以一曲“我想成为牛仔的心上人”（I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart）成为第一个乡村女明星。 \n\n当时的美国东南部，经济的不景气使得唱片销量急剧下降，但乡村音乐却通过大量广播的谷仓舞曲（radio“barn dances”）节目而维持住了它的份额。需要强调的是，不过表演的形式有所改变，从原先的演唱组表演南部山区的音乐变得更倾向于个人的演唱，如 Roy Acuff 和 Ernest Tubb 。 \n\n1934年，Decca唱片作为一个廉价品牌注册成立。在此之前，南部山区音乐在电台和舞台上的推广已进行得相当不错了。Decca成立后，它逐渐成为最重要和最伟大的乡村音乐品牌。但30年代最大的新闻却源自西部以外的新的声音。\n\nWestern Swing was the most eclectic form of country music and in its free-wheeling diversity, it set the stage for rock & roll. Based in traditional string band music, Western swing also incorporated traditional pop melodies, jazz improvisation, blues, and folk, creating a wildly entertaining and eclectic form of American music. Bob Wills and Milton Brown popularized the genre in the '30s, and Wills became known as the father of the genre, since he remained popular for several decades, during which he had a remarkable string of hit singles. Although it sometimes faded away from view, Western swing remained popular throughout the 20th century, occasionally experiencing upswings in popularity, such as in the early '70s and the early '90s.","songs":[{"id":"f4C6K413b0","name":"Straighten Up and Fly Right","artist":"3fC4f48d"},{"id":"b9ULe9b3cf","name":"Yesterday She Didn't","artist":"Esyb82f3"},{"id":"NuDM57d02","name":"Me Too","artist":"5on85a34"},{"id":"Loue56a42","name":"The Letter That Johnny Walker Read","artist":"cZkL37038"},{"id":"cgP2ue202d","name":"My Time Will Come Someday","artist":"T61d31c2"},{"id":"8GnHX9eee56","name":"Up to You and Me","artist":"dvXM39314"},{"id":"d3jJE28bfc","name":"Sitting on Top of the World","artist":"TgYc38c3"},{"id":"8Ga1L5e67eb","name":"Artistry in Western Swing","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"KPcM71a7b","name":"Hangover Heart","artist":"Tkta0cc5"},{"id":"xL3QXhc66d5","name":"Beautiful Dreamer (Album Version)","artist":"3iR4c703"},{"id":"cgImJebfe8","name":"Old Fashioned Love","artist":"3hm84c67"},{"id":"S5pX579e9","name":"Tiger Rag","artist":"BTE55731"}],"albums":[{"id":"M5T5c0fe","name":"Swing","artist":"3fC4f48d"},{"id":"nQSXf7b37","name":"Cut 'n Shoot","artist":"Esyb82f3"},{"id":"8kCx6c545","name":"II","artist":"5on85a34"},{"id":"iQ7hd0ef5","name":"Night Tide","artist":"T61d31c2"},{"id":"ei7a44783","name":"Texas Gold","artist":"cZkL37038"},{"id":"bC1Vee1b7","name":"Reinventing the Wheel","artist":"cZkL37038"},{"id":"bmEKd5e0b","name":"Hillbilly Jazz","artist":"TgYc38c3"},{"id":"b5O1P369d74","name":"Back in the Swing","artist":"dvXM39314"},{"id":"dI6t40c73","name":"Back to the Future Now - Live ...","artist":"cZkL37038"},{"id":"j4Gucc2a7","name":"Plays Hawaiian Guitar, Banjo, ...","artist":"BTE55731"},{"id":"iQ7fd7104","name":"Feelin' Kinda Lucky","artist":"T61d31c2"},{"id":"bnRLba510","name":"A   Six Pack to Go","artist":"Tkta0cc5"}],"artists":[{"id":"TkKd0587","name":"Tex Williams"},{"id":"ciJC28b52","name":"Bill Haley"},{"id":"Lzn59d32","name":"Susie Arioli"},{"id":"T61d31c2","name":"Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys"},{"id":"cZpr397a7","name":"Bob Wills"},{"id":"Esyb82f3","name":"Gurf Morlix"},{"id":"cZkL37038","name":"Asleep at the Wheel"},{"id":"dzmg428b0","name":"Jimmy Bryant"},{"id":"Tkta0cc5","name":"Hank Thompson"},{"id":"bLrR246cb","name":"Pee Wee King"},{"id":"BTE55731","name":"Roy Smeck"},{"id":"5on85a34","name":"Kinleys"}]}]},{"type":"genre","id":"6","name":"雷鬼 Reggae","description":"一种由斯卡（Ska）和洛克斯代迪（Rock Steady）音乐演变而来的牙买加流行音乐。事实上，很难在洛克斯代迪和雷鬼之间划出明确的界限。只是后者较前者更为细腻，更多地使用电声乐器和更加国际化。如果说斯卡音乐还只是在美国流行音乐的影响下产生的一种拉美流行音乐的话 ，那么雷鬼则已发展成为欧美摇滚乐主流中的一种重要体裁了。\n\t雷鬼音乐的起源\n　　在1968年左右形成于牙买加(Jamaica)起因是在'60年代，美国音乐工程师兴起和引导的一种音乐表现方式，部分音乐工程师因此出走，寻求灵感。其中有一些来到牙买加。牙买加境内原本就有一些游唱艺人存在，所以一直有股民谣气息在酝酿著；所以这一批美国音乐工程师的到来，对牙买加而言不啻是个提升音乐水准的契 机。加上当地的乐师勇于创新，肯於接受外来事物，于是给予新音乐的创造背景。\n源于牙买加\n　　雷鬼音乐发源于牙买加，其根源来自New Orleans的R&B。 当时牙买加的乐手根据广播中听到的New Orleans快节奏R&B，发展成属于自己的R&B音乐。 这种称为Ska的音乐型态，在当时60年代相当盛行。然而在一次非常热的夏天， 当地的人无法在高温的户外弹奏如此快节奏的音乐及跳舞。 当地的乐手就将音乐放慢，而形成了 Reggae音乐。 Reggae这个字是源自于「Ragged」，代表牙买加不修边幅的舞蹈形式。\n新的音乐形态\n　　而在'60年代中期，牙买加已形成一种音乐形态「Ska」，基本上已有雷鬼的影子在，但这种音乐的节奏很快；后来又发展成「Rock Steady」，节奏变得比Ska慢，再经转 变之后，并融入「Soul」(灵魂乐)，於'68年左右，「Reggae」正式成形。\n音乐型态\n\n　　雷鬼音乐结合了传统非洲节奏，美国的节奏蓝调及原始牙买加民俗音乐， 这种风格包含了”弱拍中音节省略”，“向上拍击的吉他弹奏”， 以及”人声合唱”。 歌词强调社会、政治及人文的关怀。\n雷鬼乐\n\n　　雷鬼乐是早期牙买加的流行音乐之一，它不仅融合了美国节奏蓝调的抒情曲风，同时还加入了拉丁音乐的热情。另外，雷鬼乐十分强调vocal的部份，不论是独唱或合唱，通常它是运用吟唱的方式来表现，并且藉由吉他、打击乐器、电子琴或其他乐器带出主要的旋律和节奏。而在雷鬼乐当中，你还会发现电贝斯占了相当重要的比例！雷鬼乐是属于四四拍的音乐，重音落在第二和第四拍。从音乐中大鼓的部份，我们可以清楚的听出一个明显的节奏和固定的旋律线。拥有自成一派、懒洋洋的独特节奏。\n\nReggae\n\n　　Reggae的诞生颇为辗转：它演变自Ska，一种急速，结集古巴/非洲爵士乐及美国节奏蓝调的音乐，后来经美国新奥尔良的乐手改良后变成了雷鬼，再传回牙买加。雷鬼与摇滚乐一样，只是一个统称，其支派非常多，有迷幻的Dub、类似R&B的Rocksteady、跳舞节奏的 Ragga，Dancehall Rapping等等，是牙买加最闻名的出产。\n\nReggae is a music unique to Jamiaca, but it ironically has its roots in New Orleans R&B. Reggae's direct forefather is ska, an uptempo, rhythmic variation based on the New Orleans R&B Jamaican musicians heard broadcast from the US on their transistor radios. Relying on skittering guitar and syncopated rhythms, ska was their interpretation of R&B and it was quite popular in the early '60s. However, during one very hot summer, it was too hot to either play or dance to ska, so the beat was slowed down and reggae was born. Since then, reggae has proven to be as versatile as the blues, as it lends itself to a number of interpretations, from the melodic rock steady of Alton Ellis and the rock and folk-influenced songwriting of Bob Marley to the trippy, near-psychedelic soundscapes of dub artists like Lee \"Scratch\" Perry.

The practice of re-recording reggae tracks without vocals dated back to 1967, when DJs found that dancehall crowds and partygoers greatly enjoyed being given the opportunity to sing the lyrics themselves. Around 1969, some DJs began talking, or \"toasting,\" over these instrumentals (known as \"versions\"), frequently reinterpreting the already familiar original lyrics. The most important early DJ was U-Roy, who became renowned for his ability to improvise dialogues with the recorded singers; U-Roy ran the sound system owned by engineer King Tubby, who mixed all of the instrumental tracks over which his DJ toasted. Eventually, Tubby began to experiment with remixing the instrumental tracks, bringing up the level of the rhythm section, dropping out most or all of the vocals, and adding new effects like reverb and echo. The results were seen by many reggae fans as stripping the music down to its purest essence. 45-rpm singles with dub versions on the B-sides became ubiquitous, and King Tubby's credit on the back soon became a drawing card in and of itself. Full-fledged dub albums began to appear in 1973, with many highlights stemming from Tubby's mixes for producers Bunny Lee and Augustus Pablo (the latter of whom also played the haunting melodica, which became one of dub's signature added elements); other key early producers included the minimalistic Keith Hudson and the colorful, elaborate Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. By 1976, dub's popularity in Jamaica was second only to Rastafarian roots reggae, and the sound had also found acceptance the U.K. (thanks largely to the Island label), where roots reggae artists like Burning Spear and Black Uhuru became just as well-known for their forays into dub. The Mad Professor and the experimental Adrian Sherwood helped Britain's dub scene remain vital in the '80s, but in spite of skilled newcomers like Scientist, Prince Jammy, and Mikey Dread, Jamaican popular taste had by then shifted to DJ toasters and lyrical improvisers, which led to the prominence of dancehall and ragga. The downtempo atmospherics and bass- and rhythm-heavy textures of dub had a lasting influence outside of reggae, beginning with Public Image Ltd.'s 1979 Metal Box/Second Edition album; during the '90s, dub was frequently incorporated into the melting-pot eclecticism of underground avant-garde rock, and Britain's thriving electronica/drum'n'bass scene owed a great deal to dub's mixing and production techniques.","songs":[{"id":"xNfscgb0858","name":"想太多总是没结果","artist":"GKc8cda6"},{"id":"8GnnXbf02bb","name":"暖冬的落日","artist":"9cAPOZe1fd4"},{"id":"b3mC3db0a3","name":"What Is Life?","artist":"5A159f50"},{"id":"b7o71c7be5","name":"I Chase the Devil","artist":"bafEae2b4"},{"id":"SBlk8b7c7","name":"Conspiracy Dub","artist":"Cdl866f0"},{"id":"xLtFjabe473","name":"Tout Ce Qu'ils Veulent","artist":"dJEa3ddeb"},{"id":"b4OzWdb293","name":"Money  ","artist":"bih2b837a"},{"id":"KB4J634bc","name":"Jah Love","artist":"TxMb3f38"},{"id":"mQSoDy65cf2","name":"我们最终会失去-Blind To You Riddim","artist":"GBf2U346b9"},{"id":"8Gcitjec7f5","name":"Chalwa","artist":"bkebce3ba"},{"id":"MlWr77268","name":"Problems Dub","artist":"V8P104ac"}],"albums":[{"id":"UQI6C52c802","name":"云南民间的回响","artist":"bmiqc2157"},{"id":"bqHBZr93842c","name":"跋山涉水","artist":"GKc8cda6"},{"id":"ntfF1b602","name":"Dub Side of the Moon","artist":"bih2b837a"},{"id":"rnaK25796","name":"I & I Survived (Dub)","artist":"TxMb3f38"},{"id":"kp3X146ad","name":"Hors Contrôle","artist":"dJEa3ddeb"},{"id":"vDOt280cd","name":"Laika Come Home","artist":"cBa230dec"},{"id":"ftoa559ec","name":"Remixes and Radio Cuts","artist":"Cdl866f0"},{"id":"n8E0e569c","name":"War Ina Babylon","artist":"bafEae2b4"},{"id":"srXY23a31","name":"DJ-Kicks","artist":"edSB44f06"},{"id":"iUo9e020d","name":"Rebel Rock Reggae: This Is Aug...","artist":"5AOa3743"},{"id":"bDyD1b4d1","name":"Countryman","artist":"3ir5ee6c"},{"id":"iUzt9ba35","name":"Anthem","artist":"5A159f50"}],"artists":[{"id":"GBf2U346b9","name":"YEHAIYAHAN"},{"id":"caHm22fb9","name":"蒋亮的声音系统"},{"id":"c35l28d4c","name":"远东之狮"},{"id":"WDW9d2da","name":"Joe Strummer / Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros"},{"id":"5AOa3743","name":"Augustus Pablo"},{"id":"byPD199a5","name":"Lee"},{"id":"bih2b837a","name":"Easy Star All-Stars"},{"id":"5A159f50","name":"Black Uhuru"},{"id":"ULQaa786","name":"Bill Laswell"},{"id":"TxMb3f38","name":"Bad Brains"},{"id":"VBR9988a","name":"Sly & Robbie"},{"id":"dbFT36dc3","name":"Burning Spear"}]},{"type":"style","id":"438","name":"斯卡 Ska","description":"早在50年代的中期，美国的节奏布鲁斯（Rhythm and Blues —也就是我们现在所说的R&B），通过迈阿密、新奥尔良、孟菲斯等地的广播电台传入牙买加后，当地的一些音乐家便将其与牙买加当地的传统民间音乐Mento（门特）相融合，并混杂了美式灵歌的演唱，逐渐形成了Ska（斯卡）音乐。Ska音乐的速度较快，感觉更轻易让人随之舞动蹦跳起来，更加活泼跳跃，节奏强调反拍的重音，乐队中除了采用传统的Mento音乐的乐器（如木吉他、各种拉美打击乐器）外还加入了铜管乐、\n　　电吉他、电贝司和键盘等乐器，并突出铜管的华丽色彩。而电吉它的反拍切分演奏技巧也更是体现了Ska音乐的特性，更轻易与其他音乐区别开来。Ska不仅延承了Mento中诙谐的论题和音乐上的特点，其更为欢快的节奏则更能体现出牙买加这个布满阳光和希望的加勒比海岛国的开放与热情。   Ska marked the true beginning of Jamaican popular music, coming to prominence during the early and mid-'60s right around the time the island was granted its independence. Ska ensembles were generally a blend of electric instrumentation and horns most popular in jazz (saxophone, trumpet, trombone). \n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough structurally simple, ska has a bevy of influences, synthesizing American R&B, jump blues, Jamaican mento, calypso and other Caribbean styles, big-band swing, Afro-Cuban jazz, pocomania and other local religious folk music, and European ballroom dances. Of those, the first three -- R&B, jump blues, and mento -- were the most important building blocks. Jump blues tunes -- both sax-driven instrumentals and vocal numbers by artists like Wynonie Harris and Louis Jordan -- had become wildly popular at Jamaican dance parties, with sound-system operators making frequent trips to the U.S. searching for the hottest and rarest 45s. As R&B shifted into rock & roll, less crossover-oriented American performers like Little Richard and Fats Domino also became Jamaican favorites. In 1959, when the boogie beat had become less important in rock-oriented R&B, top sound-system owners like Clement \"Coxsone\" Dodd and Duke Reid (as well as restaurateur-cum-producer Leslie Kong) took matters into their own hands, forming their own labels, acting as producers for local talent, and recording the music their audiences wanted to hear when it was no longer readily available in the U.S. From there, the music took on distinctly Jamaican characteristics, melding influences from all the different styles in which Jamaican instrumentalists had been trained. The most important of these was mento, Jamaica's first indigenous musical form; it was essentially a blend of Caribbean calypso and Jamaican folk music. Mento ensembles used the banjo to play chords on the off-beat, and when this practice was transferred to Jamaican R&B recordings, those off beats were punched up and strongly emphasized because of R&B's emphasis on driving rhythm. This was essentially the birth of ska, and that rhythmic emphasis continued to dominate Jamaican music for decades to come. Important ska vocalists included Derrick Morgan, Laurel Aitken, Prince Buster (himself a sound system owner), Desmond Dekker, Toots & the Maytals, and the very young Bob Marley and the Wailers; the Skatalites, featuring a number of virtuosic soloists and led by the mercurial trombonist Don Drummond, were far and away the top instrumental group, and also served as the house backing band for Coxsone Dodd's prolific Studio One. Ska's popularity declined in 1966, when the slower, cooler rock steady style found favor with younger listeners during the particularly hot summer; moreover, ska lost one of its top performers that year when Don Drummond was arrested for the murder of his girlfriend and committed to an institution (he died there several years later). Ska enjoyed a brief and popular revival in the U.K. during the late '70s and early '80s, thanks to the enthusiasm of many British punk fans for reggae records, and the skipping, infectious ska beat in particular. A more rock-oriented take on ska became popular in the U.S. during the '90s, although it was much farther removed from the music's Jamaican origins than the British version had been.","songs":[{"id":"gjSQj4b18e","name":"London Calling","artist":"2DS5f307"},{"id":"cisb21bd40","name":"Three Little Birds","artist":"V8C168e8"},{"id":"xLs81te0c00","name":"Brutal Hearts","artist":"bCcD1e019"},{"id":"xL2lvIadd60","name":"云南雷鬼","artist":"bmiqc2157"},{"id":"cOfXJ25121","name":"Never Grow Old","artist":"57U91529"},{"id":"b2uKe98c0c","name":"Is This Love","artist":"iTVic8e82"},{"id":"xLtFjabe473","name":"Tout Ce Qu'ils Veulent","artist":"dJEa3ddeb"},{"id":"mQSoDy65cf2","name":"我们最终会失去-Blind To You Riddim","artist":"GBf2U346b9"},{"id":"xL0oLFd5e1a","name":"To You","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"K5BD4dad7","name":"A Message to You Rudy","artist":"bsNVe66c0"},{"id":"mQ3wH0744b4","name":"Israelites","artist":"57A86a51"}],"albums":[{"id":"iVvFc389f","name":"Exodus","artist":"V8C168e8"},{"id":"bdwBb7f0d","name":"London Calling","artist":"2DS5f307"},{"id":"mn6vJ487196","name":"音渡神游","artist":"bjAWd6e24"},{"id":"m7cZ2X809cd","name":"云南雷鬼","artist":"bmiqc2157"},{"id":"nh4Jfd476","name":"Kaya","artist":"iTVic8e82"},{"id":"kp3X146ad","name":"Hors Contrôle","artist":"dJEa3ddeb"},{"id":"nh0U197a4","name":"True Love","artist":"57U91529"},{"id":"nh4Nf5845","name":"Chances Are","artist":"V8C168e8"},{"id":"8gnI3e4f0","name":"Soul Rebels","artist":"V8C168e8"},{"id":"9q9o3c3d0","name":"玩具头乐队","artist":"bkKFc0afb"},{"id":"fXvQ88d14","name":"Light the Horizon","artist":"bCcD1e019"},{"id":"bpOg3u43565c","name":"大都市","artist":"bkKFc0afb"}],"artists":[{"id":"V8C168e8","name":"Bob Marley"},{"id":"caHm22fb9","name":"蒋亮的声音系统"},{"id":"bjAWd6e24","name":"板砖乐队"},{"id":"bsNVe66c0","name":"The Specials"},{"id":"clB427e90","name":"The Skatalites"},{"id":"dJEa3ddeb","name":"Dub Incorporation"},{"id":"GKc8cda6","name":"龍錦"},{"id":"btWpDf8cdd6","name":"夏日入侵企画"},{"id":"9vP870a7","name":"Ska-P"},{"id":"Eni682a5","name":"東京スカパラダイスオーケストラ"},{"id":"bkKFc0afb","name":"蜜糖先生乐队"},{"id":"57U91529","name":"Toots & the Maytals"}]},{"type":"style","id":"456","name":"雷鬼流行 Reggae Pop","description":"Reggae-Pop has its foundation in reggae, but the music is tempered with strong, melodic hooks, commercial production, and a crossover sensibility.

The style is most commonly associated with dancehall, and while not all dancehall reggae is electronic (and therefore not ragga), there is a great deal of overlap between the two. \"Ragga\" is short for \"raggamuffin,\" originally a term for a Kingston ghetto youth; the music took on that name as it became the younger generation's style of choice in the mid- to late '80s. Because of the relatively low costs of building synthesized rhythms, ragga became the preferred mode for many Jamaican producers as well, enabling them to turn out thousands of singles per year, and to craft more adventurous new rhythms instead of simply borrowing them from old rock steady records. This also led to the explosion of the \"rhythm album,\" for which different artists would record their own lyrics and melodies over the same pre-existing rhythm track. Although ragga is linked in the minds of many with deejay toasting, straight-ahead singers often address romantic and Rastafarian concerns, and the two vocal styles are frequently mixed as well. The first ragga record was Wayne Smith's 1985 single \"Under Me Sleng Teng,\" which was produced by King Jammy and built around a rhythm that was discovered pre-programmed on a Casio keyboard. Its impact was immediate, spawning a host of imitators and establishing Jammy for a time as Jamaica's most dominant producer. During the '90s, ragga remained firmly entrenched as the most popular sound in Jamaican dancehalls. It began to incorporate hip-hop sampling techniques, and several of its artists scored pop crossover hits in the U.S.; ragga was also an important influence on the U.K.'s thriving jungle/drum'n'bass scene.","songs":[{"id":"b3gHycf835","name":"Luv Me, Luv Me","artist":"UdUd4f52"},{"id":"xLsyF7d8415","name":"拥抱","artist":"biebada21"},{"id":"gsMFt44725","name":"Summer Breezin","artist":"CRo54e50"},{"id":"ciey516d35","name":"Things in Life","artist":"57X7cd42"},{"id":"cjNxlf21d4","name":"Street Life","artist":"bvAne40b2"},{"id":"MaaF88b66","name":"Ganja Smuggling","artist":"58A6417f"},{"id":"eR1H7394c8","name":"Want a Woman","artist":"bvAXfef3e"},{"id":"b802Xda639","name":"No Way Jose","artist":"bbQMd4219"},{"id":"xNbtwX11541","name":"早上我拿着根儿油条不爱喝豆浆","artist":"dsF8d6ac"},{"id":"chCFLf26cb","name":"Ting-A-Ling","artist":"bvAN2ea5b"}],"albums":[{"id":"5hxL35a89","name":"拥抱","artist":"biebada21"},{"id":"g9o8521cf","name":"Free the Universe","artist":"bgsadb57e"},{"id":"iXrUbd25d","name":"Hot Shot","artist":"UdUd4f52"},{"id":"9c9TJ4f671e","name":"Know No Better","artist":"bgsadb57e"},{"id":"jNXY9df03","name":"Guns Don't Kill People...

The musical structure is rooted in reggae though the rhythms, played by drum machines, are considerably faster. By the '90s, dancehall crossover was common, with many gangsta-rappers incorporating dancehall rhythms and its rapid-fire toasting.

Rocksteady","description":"Rocksteady其实代表的正是牙买加音乐的一个高峰，她是ska的其中一个分支。Ska音乐流行于1960至1965年之间，到60年代中期逐渐演变为Rocksteady音乐。Rocksteady与Ska相比，它的速度明显放慢，节奏及旋律更为细腻丰富；其乐队完全采用节奏布鲁斯的组合方式，将吉他作为节奏乐器，用切音技巧演奏松弛而富有韵律的节奏音型；贝司声部的旋律也更具独立性，与华丽的主唱声部构成对位，成为美妙的低音铺垫，相对来说要求有一定的技术性和演奏技巧。60年末，Rocksteady又发展成更具国际性的Reggae（雷鬼）音乐。实际上，很难在Rocksteady和Reggae之间划出明显的界限，只是Reggae比Rocksteady更为细腻，更多地使用电声乐器和更加国际化、商业化而已，没有Rocksteady那么明显的牙买加传统地方特性。不过Rocksteady在Reggae乐的发展中扮演了重要的角色，Rocksteady主要代表艺人有Alton Ellis、Ken Boothe与The Melodians等，他们的歌曲动听，歌词却布满了政治意味，对接踵而至的Reggae做了很好的铺垫，成为Reggae乐的先锋。   Rocksteady was a style of popular music that developed out of ska in the 1960s. In its simplest terms, rocksteady is half-speed ska with the trombone replaced by piano and prominent bass. The lyrics are more socially and politically conscious, and there is a greater focus on harmonies, particularly in trios like the Heptones, Gaylads, Dominoes, Aces, and Wailers. Other major figures include Alton Ellis and Ken Boothe. With its relaxed beat and social-protest lyrics, the music served as a forerunner to reggae.","songs":[{"id":"cisb21bd40","name":"Three Little Birds","artist":"V8C168e8"},{"id":"b2uKe98c0c","name":"Is

Classical","description":"古典音乐是一个含义广泛的术语，广义的西洋古典音乐是指那些从西方中世纪开始至今、并在欧洲主流文化背景下创作的音乐，或者指植根于西方传统礼拜式音乐和世俗音乐，其范围涵盖了约公元11世纪至今的全部时期。主要因其复杂多样的创作技术和所能承载的厚重内涵而有别於通俗音乐和民间音乐。在地理上，这些音乐主要创作於欧洲和美洲，这是相对於非西方音乐而言的。另外，西洋古典音乐主要以乐谱记录和传播，和大多数民间音乐口传心授的模式不同。\n\n亦有人认为“古典”是对应于“流行”而言的，因为这些音乐经得起时间的考验，能够引起不同时代听众的共鸣，故认为应当称之为“经典”（classic）的音乐。\n\n但如果细究古典一词，本意可以理解为古代留传下来堪称经典的音乐作品（古代+经典），但是一般来说，古典音乐是具有规则性本质的音乐，具有平衡、明晰的特点，注重形式的美感，被认為具有持久的价值，而不仅仅是在一个特定的时代流行。这也体现於“古典”（classical）与“经典”（classic）的不同。\n\n古典音乐（classical music）本来是专指德奥在1750—1820年间以海顿、莫扎特、贝多芬為代表的音乐，即所谓“维也纳古典乐派”的音乐（或翻译為“维也纳古典主义音乐”）。这就是狭义的古典音乐。\n\n从这个狭义的古典音乐概念出发，我们可以向前追溯到巴赫、亨德尔，乃至更早的天主教、基督教的宗教音乐，向后延伸到浪漫主义、民族乐派，以及20世纪西方的现代音乐。这些都是广义的古典音乐，也就是基於这个传统的，无论是继承和发扬这个传统，还是试图以创新来突破这个传统的音乐创作尝试，都可以归入古典音乐之内。而在这个传统外独立发展的音乐，虽然有借鉴和影响古典音乐创作的，但是一般也不归入古典音乐之内，比如爵士乐、摇滚乐，以及东方一些民族的音乐。\n因此对于广义的“古典音乐”这个词来说，欧洲艺术音乐的定义更加准确。\n\n欧洲艺术音乐与其他的非欧洲音乐和流行音乐体系的主要区别是记谱法有所不同，其规则大约源自于16世纪便开始使用的记谱法。在西方记谱法中，作曲者给演奏者规定了音调、格律、速度，独特的节奏和对于一同段音乐准确的演奏方式。这种即兴演奏发挥空间很小的记谱法模式，极大的不同于非欧洲艺术音乐（相对于传统的日本音乐和印度音乐）和流行音乐。\n\n古典音乐作為音乐中类别的称呼，是相对于轻音乐、通俗音乐等类别而存在，它本身并没有严格明确的解释或者定义。在轻音乐范围里，有时也採采用“古典”的概念来指某些经过时间检验，被人们奉为楷模的轻音乐作品，如古典轻歌剧、古典爵士乐等，这里的 classical 理解为“古代+经典”，似乎更为合适一些。","songs":[{"id":"xL2MPib1055","name":"Rather Be","artist":"xMVzuad28b2"},{"id":"mQGrKU68452","name":"向往 (2013版)","artist":"EIca21f"},{"id":"eYl5P37f9c","name":"Canon

Because its instrument is the body itself, it is the most primal music produced by humans and is common to all cultures. It is most frequently expressed as song, words sung to a melody. At least since the Middle Ages, songs have commonly been accompanied by a string instrument, often played by the singer, a tradition that continues to the present. Art songs with piano accompaniment often gathered into thematically-related cycles, came to prominence in the 19th century in the works of Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, and Wolf. Nearly all European composers of the era wrote songs. Post-Romantic composers like Mahler and Richard Strauss popularized songs and song cycles with orchestral accompaniment, and songs have been significant in the output of modern composers such as Poulenc, Britten, and Barber.","songs":[{"id":"b4HdFf28fa","name":"Scarborough Fair","artist":"WkIe0014"},{"id":"gtNk64a9f3","name":"Звезда","artist":"6i26aa9b"},{"id":"ckLf8f1987","name":"Besame Mucho","artist":"WrLa1891"},{"id":"8GazeOe3fb6","name":"Satie: 3 Gymnopédies - I.

The word \"orchestra\" came into common use in the 18th century, when music of the Baroque and Classical eras often was composed for specific occasions. Incidental music to accompany plays was also important in the Classical and early Romantic eras. The Romantics threw off the constraints of pre-established forms and luxuriated in the possibilities offered by the expansion of instruments available. Liszt pioneered the tone poem or symphonic poem. Orchestral dances like \"On the Beautiful Blue Danube\" have lost none of their popularity. For much of the 20th century, the orchestra stood at the center of community life in classical music, and new works appeared accordingly. The success of pieces like John Adams' \"A Short Ride in a Fast Machine,\" shows that the orchestra remains a vital medium, even in an age of high technology.","songs":[{"id":"xL1fN6b2f7e","name":"Johann Strauss II: An der schönen blauen Donau, Op.314","artist":"bjHRafd47"},{"id":"mQBdAX8a00e","name":"Dmitri Shostakovich: Suite for Jazz Orchestra No.2 - 7.

Opera was invented around the turn of the 17th century by a group of Florentine musicians who were trying to replicate the form of Greek theatre in which drama and music were combined. One of their members, Claudio Monteverdi, wrote the first great opera, Orfeo, in 1607. Virtuoso singing soon came to be a central element, and many operas give the singers the opportunity for spectacular vocal display. The subject matter of operas can be as diverse as that of plays, and the musical styles reflect the vast variety of all music. Operas may range from the small and intimate to the most extravagantly grand, but in the best of them, the music and drama work together to heighten the intensity of each other, making opera one of the most emotionally potent art forms.","songs":[{"id":"mQHrgK7f1e2","name":"George Frideric Handel: Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno, oratorio, HWV 46a - Part 1.

The singers may perform without accompaniment, or may be accompanied by any instrumental combination, from piano to full orchestra. Plainchant, the oldest notated Western music, dating from the 9th century, was sung in unison (all voices singing the same melody) by monks. Choral music, mostly liturgical, remained the primary focus of composers through the Renaissance. Using highly sophisticated harmonies and counterpoint (the interweaving of many melodies), they created a significant and diverse body of works. Some of the greatest works by Baroque composers J.S. Bach and Handel were choral, and all but a handful of prominent composers since then have contributed to the choral repertoire. Thanks to church choirs, school choirs, and local choral associations, which are particularly popular in the US and the UK, choral singing provides the most widespread opportunities for amateur music-making.","songs":[{"id":"xLpXqsba467","name":"Heart of Courage","artist":"bisAd86ee"},{"id":"Uu8c5aae7","name":"Les choristes","artist":"beImacdf5"},{"id":"8GfiONfd16d","name":"Johann Sebastian Bach: Suite No.3 in D, BWV 1068 - II.

Typically, a symphony is a multi-movement, multi-character work for orchestra, with origins in the sinfonias that served as curtain-raisers for operas in the early 17th century. In the Classical era, Haydn perfected the form, which would bring forth masterpieces from Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, Sibelius, Shostakovich, Ives, and so many others. As it developed, symphonies began to encompass more than abstract musical ideas, embracing programmatic narratives, nationalistic characteristics, and modern compositional techniques such as serialism. Even in the 21st century, when the costs -- financial and otherwise -- of performing such large-scale works can seem prohibitive, composers like Einojuhani Rautavaara, Philip Glass, and Tan Dun are still compelled to write them.","songs":[{"id":"mQBdAX8a00e","name":"Dmitri Shostakovich: Suite for Jazz Orchestra No.2 - 7.

C.瓦根塞尔等都重视乐队色彩的运用，扩大管乐器的作用，并使小提琴成为乐队的主体，他们与斯塔米茨一起都为发展交响曲作出了一定的贡献。","songs":[{"id":"mQBdAX8a00e","name":"Dmitri Shostakovich: Suite for Jazz Orchestra No.2 - 7.

In its most common manifestations, ballet combines music and dance to tell a story. It was brought to perfection in the 19th century, peaking with France's Adolph Adam and Russia's Tchaikovsky. Stravinsky and Copland composed the most well-loved ballets of the 20th century, both representing the tradition of great ballet music arising as collaborations between composer and choreographer, such as that of John Cage and Merce Cunningham. For much of the 20th century new dance works were designated by the term \"modern dance\" rather than \"ballet,\" and were more abstract in subject. Modern choreographers tend to draw eclectically on a variety of musical sources for their works. Meredith Monk is an inventive, contemporary creative figure whose works include both music and dance elements.","songs":[{"id":"xLrOUee1a77","name":"Camille Saint-Saëns: Le Carnaval des Animaux - Le Cygne","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"mQ9uQm914d4","name":"Frédéric Chopin: Nocturne No.2 in E flat, Op.9 No.2","artist":"Lfz5cd42"},{"id":"mQ31De59c80","name":"Standchen (Serenade) D 957 No.4","artist":"Gn25fb69"},{"id":"mQAN0x69365","name":"Johannes Brahms: Hungarian Dance No.5 in G minor, Orchestrated by Martin Schmeling (?-1943)","artist":"bjHRafd47"},{"id":"b1pQLCK3c99d","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Piano Sonata No.10 In C Major, K.330 - 1.

Chamber ensembles range from two to eight or nine musicians, within families of string, wind, brass, and even percussion instruments, or combining diverse instruments. The most characteristic form is the string quartet (two violins, viola, and cello), perfected by Haydn. Chamber music of the Romantic era came mostly from composers who extended the forms they inherited from Mozart and Beethoven. Perhaps the greatest 19th century composer of chamber music was Brahms, whose depth of musical thought influenced even his most experimental successors. Chamber music in the 20th century showed composers making each piece of music into a miniature sound world of its own in a medium that would display what they were doing with maximum clarity. More new works are written today for chamber ensembles than for orchestra or the stage.","songs":[{"id":"bBi8v16306","name":"少女的祈祷","artist":"FAq5ab82"},{"id":"A4r8eac1","name":"舒伯特:小夜曲","artist":"135fbd3"},{"id":"xLqg6g972d3","name":"Frédéric Chopin: Nocturne No. 1 in B Flat Minor, Op. 9, No. 1","artist":"bhz0a7462"},{"id":"xLrMDxa9777","name":"Bad Romance YouTube","artist":"dlqG37351"},{"id":"mQBdAX8a00e","name":"Dmitri Shostakovich: Suite for Jazz Orchestra No.2 - 7.

In the most common type of crossover, classically trained performers (most often operatic superstars) sing popular songs, folk music, show tunes, or holiday songs. Crossover may refer to pop stars singing classical repertoire. Crossover can also be applied to the work of artists, vocal or instrumental, who attempt to create a synthesis between a classical and a popular style, such as jazz interpretations of traditional classical pieces, or contemporary classical works that are heavily influenced by rock. Music that doesn't fall comfortably into either category, but that might appeal to both pop and classical fans, such as world music and non-Western folk traditions, is sometimes also classified as crossover.","songs":[{"id":"xL2MPib1055","name":"Rather Be","artist":"xMVzuad28b2"},{"id":"mQGrKU68452","name":"向往 (2013版)","artist":"EIca21f"},{"id":"b4HdFf28fa","name":"Scarborough Fair","artist":"WkIe0014"},{"id":"SZtW6215c","name":"Croatian Rhapsody","artist":"cIJp2d833"},{"id":"xLvtua1f71d","name":"Purple Passion","artist":"na5Le95fd"},{"id":"xLyWvIb475a","name":"Because of You","artist":"c2Zz2ad1e"},{"id":"bBrKe225a4","name":"He's a Pirate","artist":"bVOF36f72"},{"id":"gtNk64a9f3","name":"Звезда","artist":"6i26aa9b"},{"id":"mQMHk283625","name":"Empire of Angels","artist":"bEjsfd811"},{"id":"mQ3tui64290","name":"Requiem For A Tower","artist":"cwhM28c48"},{"id":"mQ41ee12ca9","name":"Rio Carneval","artist":"F5G5a181"},{"id":"ckLf8f1987","name":"Besame Mucho","artist":"WrLa1891"}],"albums":[{"id":"i4jsYZ3c0d0","name":"拾光","artist":"EIca21f"},{"id":"kyAmda1a7","name":"Beethoven Virus","artist":"na5Le95fd"},{"id":"ns5rfb80c","name":"La Luna","artist":"WkIe0014"},{"id":"nKlve403c","name":"The Piano Player","artist":"cIJp2d833"},{"id":"bpOKc2F392d1","name":"New Eyes","artist":"d9eF67fae73"},{"id":"xunI288ec","name":"Best Of Both Worlds","artist":"c2Zz2ad1e"},{"id":"nXVi189cc","name":"Encore","artist":"bVOF36f72"},{"id":"f2Ze91645","name":"A New World","artist":"cIJp2d833"},{"id":"jFJXe04f6","name":"Vitas : The Myth of the Shakin...","artist":"6i26aa9b"},{"id":"8ISsRpf7cdf","name":"Sun","artist":"bEjsfd811"},{"id":"eUJd8d906","name":"Amore","artist":"WrLa1891"},{"id":"jNdD11ca2","name":"Escala","artist":"cwhM28c48"}],"artists":[{"id":"bVOF36f72","name":"David Garrett"},{"id":"cIJp2d833","name":"Maksim Mrvica"},{"id":"WkIe0014","name":"Sarah Brightman"},{"id":"WrLa1891","name":"Andrea Bocelli"},{"id":"6i26aa9b","name":"Vitas"},{"id":"bFJHe5fec","name":"Lindsey Stirling"},{"id":"d8s2427ef","name":"Libera"},{"id":"na5Le95fd","name":"Diana Boncheva"},{"id":"cCrE306e2","name":"Sissel"},{"id":"A8Q4e39a","name":"Il Divo"},{"id":"bEZze9d95","name":"2CELLOS"},{"id":"bAZPec23e","name":"Cicada"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3278","name":"康塔塔 Cantata","description":"康塔塔（Cantata）是一种包括独唱、重唱、合唱的声乐套曲，一般包含一个以上的乐章，大都有管弦乐伴奏。\n\n形式与主题\n\n一首典型的康塔塔往往以序曲或者合唱开头，以合唱结尾，中间交错有伴奏的宣叙调，独唱或者重唱的咏叹调以及不同规模的合唱。可以看出，康塔塔旧译作大合唱是不准确的，因为在康塔塔中不只是合唱，独唱和重唱往往也有非常重要的地位。\n\n宗教康塔塔一般比叙事性的清唱剧（oratorio）规模小，内容偏重抒情或论述。世俗康塔塔则包罗万象。\n\n词源与历史\n\nCantata一词来自意大利语的歌唱cantare，英语等其他西方语言也大多原样使用这个词。cantata 与演奏 sonata 相对，分别用来指音乐的两种形式，即声乐和器乐。\n\n16世纪-17世纪：意大利\n\n16世纪意大利音乐以声乐为主，到了17世纪器乐开始崛起，并发展出奏鸣曲的形式，与之相对的声乐表演形式也开始被称为康塔塔。\n\n康塔塔在意大利最早是一种世俗声乐套曲，由数首独唱返始咏叹调（或其原始形式）和穿插其间的宣叙调组成，和牧歌一样，主题是田园，爱情等等。这种意大利风格的早期世俗康塔塔一般是独唱的，以鲁特琴或通奏低音伴奏，后来发展出多声部的形式。这种一至两个声部的室内康塔塔，在17世纪中叶一直到18世纪后期，在意大利一直很受欢迎。和用于宗教场合的宗教康塔塔，后者由卡里希米（Carissimi）发展为宗教清唱剧‎。\n\n这一时期最著名的康塔塔作曲家莫过于意大利的亚历山大·斯卡拉蒂，他主要创作独唱加通奏低音伴奏的康塔塔，共有600首之多，此外还有独唱和其他乐器组合的60余首，以及一些两声部的室内康塔塔。\n\n17世纪-18世纪：德国\n\n17世纪中叶，德国产生了德国式的宗教康塔塔。这种康塔塔一定程度上独立于意大利世俗和宗教康塔塔的发展，在巴赫的时代达到了高峰。\n\n德国的宗教康塔塔发展的土壤是马丁·路德开创的众赞歌的音乐传统，众赞歌在其中起了基础和骨架的作用。布克斯特胡德、帕赫贝尔都作有这种类型的宗教康塔塔。\n\n巴赫的早期宗教康塔塔按照更早的传统称为“经文歌”或“协奏曲”，其中合唱和重唱占据主导地位，著名的代表有第4康塔塔《耶稣躺在枯骨堆中》或译作《基督背负死亡枷锁》。可以听到巴赫使用了同名众赞歌作为骨架，每一句歌词作为一个乐章的主题，进行变奏。\n\n巴赫创作成熟期的一百多首康塔塔展示了德国式宗教康塔塔的几种典型结构，在这些结构中，康塔塔的中段一般都是由包含对比主题的独唱咏叹调，宣叙调，重唱以及合唱构成的，主要的区别在于首位段落。大部分的康塔塔首尾段落为圣经词句或是众赞歌作为歌词的合唱，这些合唱大多具有利托奈罗曲式，部分康塔塔结尾使用所有会众共同参与的众赞合唱，有一些康塔塔在开场合唱之前还有序曲。\n\n巴赫的创作相比前人突出独唱的作用，他大量使用独唱的返始咏叹调，甚至创作了独唱康塔塔，例如第82康塔塔“我厌倦了”。众赞歌的作用同样重要。可以说，巴赫是康塔塔创作的高峰，现在我们仍然演奏传唱的康塔塔主要是他的作品，尽管在他的时代，高产的泰勒曼，“就像别人写一封信一样”的创作了2000多首康塔塔，但是那些如同流水帐一般的作品大多已经被束之高阁，成为了音乐史学者们和猎奇的音乐爱好者的研究品，不再回响在人们的耳鼓里了。\n\n19世纪-20世纪：巴赫之后\n\n19世纪之后，随着乐队规模的扩大，宗教题材的康塔塔与清唱剧的界限变得模糊，同时大量的世俗康塔塔出现，也大大丰富了康塔塔的创作题材和形式，让界定康塔塔变得更加困难。\n\n巴赫之后的著名康塔塔还有贝多芬的《悼念约瑟夫皇帝康塔塔》，巴托克的《世俗康塔塔》，奥尔夫的《博伊伦之歌》等等。\n\n还有一些作品虽然叫做清唱剧，但也可以归入康塔塔的范畴，例如沃尔顿的《伯沙撒王的宴会》；而另一些作品虽然名称是康塔塔，但是却不再符合巴赫为典范的康塔塔形式，例如斯特拉文斯基的《康塔塔》，他使用了两位独唱，女声合唱和六件乐器。","songs":[{"id":"xLov6B9ef3e","name":"Carl Orff: Carmina Burana, scenic cantata for soloists, choruses & orchestra - Introduction, Fortune","artist":"eHrr87462"},{"id":"xL9Rij98f52","name":"Johann Sebastian Bach: Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen!, BWV 51 - Aria: Hochster, mache deine Gute (Soprano)","artist":"bCmYyhm4728e"},{"id":"xL5OOY9ab52","name":"Johann Sebastian Bach: Cantata No. 7 \"Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam,\" BWV 7 (BC A177) - Aria.

The organ is the oldest of keyboard instruments, dating back to the 3rd century BCE. Nearly all of the early keyboard music grew out of the tradition of accompanying church services with organ. The harpsichord came into wide use in the 15th century, but the instrument that dominates keyboard music, the piano, did not come along until the early 1700s. The capability of the instrument to produce both loud and quiet, controlled notes, as well as percussive sounds, opened the floodgates to a world of music that can be dramatic, lyrical, transcendent, or experimental -- almost as wide-ranging as music for any instrumental ensemble. The repertoire has a rich history of masterpieces composed by virtuoso performers.","songs":[{"id":"bBi8v16306","name":"少女的祈祷","artist":"FAq5ab82"},{"id":"xLrOUee1a77","name":"Camille Saint-Saëns: Le Carnaval des Animaux - Le Cygne","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"bCk84dM478a7","name":"Croatian Rhapsody","artist":"cIJp2d833"},{"id":"xLqg6g972d3","name":"Frédéric Chopin: Nocturne No. 1 in B Flat Minor, Op. 9, No. 1","artist":"bhz0a7462"},{"id":"mQBdAX8a00e","name":"Dmitri Shostakovich: Suite for Jazz Orchestra No.2 - 7.

As such, neoclassicism was a reaction against the unrestrained emotionalism and perceived formlessness of late Romanticism, as well as a \"call to order\" after the experimental ferment of the first two decades of the twentieth century. The neoclassical impulse found its expression in such features as the use of pared-down performing forces, an emphasis on rhythm and on contrapuntal texture, an updated or expanded tonal harmony, and a concentration on absolute music as opposed to Romantic program music. In form and thematic technique, neoclassical music often drew inspiration from music of the 18th century, though the inspiring canon belonged as frequently to the Baroque and even earlier periods as to the Classical period—for this reason, music which draws inspiration specifically from the Baroque is sometimes termed Neo-Baroque music. Neoclassicism had two distinct national lines of development, French (proceeding partly from the influence of Erik Satie and represented by Igor Stravinsky), and German (proceeding from the \"New Objectivity\" of Ferruccio Busoni and represented by Paul Hindemith.) Neoclassicism was an aesthetic trend rather than an organized movement; even many composers not usually thought of as \"neoclassicists\" absorbed elements of the style.","songs":[{"id":"xL8SB8bcf50","name":"妈妈","artist":"mQTb7485ec8"},{"id":"mQOWqK6b97c","name":"君生我未生","artist":"bkNRcf8ef"},{"id":"mSMhpo94b43","name":"You'll Do it","artist":"yiutAcc33ba"},{"id":"xLFo9Adf32a","name":"Morning Coffee","artist":"dIb22c3"},{"id":"nwbWee241","name":"地上的种子","artist":"dv354746"},{"id":"mQNZMU765bb","name":"硝化海马体","artist":"8J6Cgbfac14"},{"id":"xL7fql9ef4a","name":"香赞","artist":"dBWP41871"},{"id":"b4NICaa252","name":"幻","artist":"bwsLeabdf"},{"id":"xL8LeLd5658","name":"野蜂飞舞","artist":"UuDwdJ26b3e"},{"id":"mQ7aDL8ba5c","name":"Shadow","artist":"mwKDkM72746"},{"id":"bqvttIe3525e","name":"光阴 (demo)","artist":"eh9AQufe57b"},{"id":"mQNimR8aee2","name":"爱若不在-version","artist":"89updpf3192"}],"albums":[{"id":"xHWPHTb3b1d","name":"妈妈","artist":"mQTb7485ec8"},{"id":"9czwmqe53cd","name":"Constantine Blue","artist":"dIb22c3"},{"id":"b1tJkq14328f","name":"君生我未生","artist":"bkNRcf8ef"},{"id":"cEqRIFb7438","name":"诗经·南有嘉鱼","artist":"bkNRcf8ef"},{"id":"nnhSxd68f9b","name":"You'll Do it","artist":"yiutAcc33ba"},{"id":"eUJ653f60","name":"幻","artist":"bwsLeabdf"},{"id":"gh6xZq2c6a8","name":"天空下的孩子（EP）","artist":"dBWP41871"},{"id":"CohV35e3e37","name":"PLANET GOLD","artist":"yiz87ra2547"},{"id":"Jgt1o21f1e3","name":"野蜂飞舞","artist":"UuDwdJ26b3e"},{"id":"mFm2Za69e7d","name":"光阴 (demo)","artist":"eh9AQufe57b"},{"id":"Cogk9uffe18","name":"钢琴随笔·八月（2020）","artist":"iTor15c00"},{"id":"yhVZDPd7ace","name":"Colors Hidden Within The Gray","artist":"bMsf2252c"}],"artists":[{"id":"bisAd86ee","name":"Two Steps From Hell"},{"id":"WoSd3bd2","name":"Ólafur Arnalds"},{"id":"CUI52453","name":"Igor Stravinsky"},{"id":"b2fF19980","name":"Sergei Prokofiev"},{"id":"ccaP8U60453","name":"Bruno Bavota"},{"id":"b67Lf7015","name":"Dargaard"},{"id":"CdQ61b03","name":"Benjamin Britten"},{"id":"bhGHd05d3","name":"吉松隆"},{"id":"b2W8e8745","name":"Francis Poulenc"},{"id":"diTN38889","name":"Heitor Villa-Lobos"},{"id":"bg4Vbc06d","name":"Legousia Hybrida"},{"id":"bdq4c8b45","name":"William Walton"}]},{"type":"style","id":"3279","name":"清唱剧 Oratorio","description":"清唱剧（Oratorio）是一种类似歌剧的大型声乐体裁，但它有一个叙述故事的人，通常同时使用管弦乐团、独唱家以及合唱团。\n\n形式\n\n清唱剧通常包含以下部份：\n序曲，作为引子引出整部作品，给出基调。常见的形式是慢板开始到快板赋格段。\n宣叙调，可以用于表现剧中人物的对话，或者以叙述者的角度来交代剧情，起到连贯整部作品结构的作用。\n咏叹调，声乐家独唱或重唱，主要抒发剧中人的情感，此时剧情往往是静止的。\n合唱，表现群众场面，或者发表作者的看法和观点。\n大合唱，通常为宏伟的，用来传达荣耀的感觉，清唱剧中的合唱经常会使用到定音鼓、小号等乐器伴奏。\n\n在亨德尔的时代，清唱剧演出时往往还有大协奏曲作为序曲前的铺垫或者幕间休息的间奏曲同时演出。\n\n风格\n\n清唱剧与歌剧在音乐型态和风格等许多方面都非常的类似，其和歌剧最大的不同在于清唱剧没有布景、化妆以及戏剧表演，且合唱在清唱剧中的地位更加重要。\n\n清唱剧大都包含有宣叙调。相对于歌剧强调戏剧张力的对白而言，清唱剧的宣叙调通常更强调为作品铺陈结构，同时展示作曲家的审美趣味。\n\n清唱剧的咏叹调可以温柔甜美，也可以精巧热烈。许多咏叹调都可以单独演唱，成为传世经典，例如亨德尔的《以色列人在埃及》当中的“上帝是我的力量”。\n\n清唱剧当中合唱和大合唱往往占据了非常重要的地位，他们被用来表现群众一同祈祷，同声赞美等等宏大的场面。大合唱一般气势雄伟，音响宏大，亨德尔的《弥赛亚》第二部分终曲《哈利路亚大合唱》更是大大小小的合唱团和唱诗班的保留曲目，在西方几乎人人皆知。\n\n历史及著名作品\n\n清唱剧起源于意大利的奥拉托利会举行的戏剧表演，Oratorio一词便来自于奥拉托利会Oratory。当时的戏剧表演主题多是宗教性质的，有时有音乐伴奏。到了1600年前后，卡莱瓦利创作了第一部清唱剧《灵与肉的体现》，此时的演出还要求演员穿戏装，但音乐在其中已经占据了重要地位。卡里希米创作的清唱剧主要是为音乐会演出的，不再要求演出者穿戏装，也没有戏剧布景，从此正式确定了清唱剧的表演形式。\n\n在德国，许茨为清唱剧的发展做出了重要的贡献，他创作了复活清唱剧和圣诞清唱剧。\n\n清唱剧的发展大约在18世纪时达到巅峰。\n\n亨德尔创作了大约30部宗教和世俗清唱剧。他的第一部宗教清唱剧是1738年的《以色列人在埃及》，最后一部是1751年的《耶夫塔》，这些作品成为此后一百年英国音乐中最受人欢迎的作品，同时也是最著名的清唱剧作品。亨德尔的清唱剧当中，最著名的当属《弥赛亚》，他本人最为欣赏的是《参孙》。亨德尔也作有多首世俗性质的清唱剧，如著名的《塞墨勒》取材于希腊神话。亨德尔的大部分清唱剧都以英语写成，但是最后一部《时间与真理的胜利》当中他回归了自己的母语德语。\n\n同时期的著名清唱剧还有巴赫的六部《圣诞节清唱剧》，《复活节清唱剧》以及《升天节清唱剧》。\n\n在亨德尔和巴赫之后，海顿以亨德尔为榜样创作了《四季》和《创世记》，贝多芬曾写过《基督在橄榄山》（不算很成功）。19世纪的清唱剧代表作有门德尔松的《以利亚》，在当时大受好评。\n\n到了20世纪，斯特拉文斯基在其新古典主义创作时期写过歌剧-清唱剧《俄狄浦斯王》，取材于希腊神话。英国作曲家埃尔加写过多首清唱剧，其中最著名的《吉伦舍斯之梦》是否属于清唱剧音乐学者一直有争议；蒂皮特的《我们时代的孩子》受到了极高的评价，他的题材是纳粹对犹太人的屠杀；此外布里顿的著名作品《战争安魂曲》也被认为具有清唱剧的形式。由此我们也可以看到清唱剧的发展即使到了20世纪仍然是由英国作曲家主导的，这与亨德尔在英国音乐史上的深远影响是分不开的。","songs":[{"id":"8Gfn0ke4f61","name":"Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov: Scheherazade, Op.35 -

music is a catch-all term for a number of diverse styles from different regions and countries in Latin America. Often, the term refers to Latin pop -- either dance-based or pop oriented-music sung in Spanish or Tejano. Tejano has a number of different styles, from romantic ballads to the narrative nortenos, and they're usually performed by large groups with acoustic instruments and horns. In the '80s and '90s, Tejano has also adopted smooth production techniques from American pop-rock and soft rock. Latin America is also known for such dance music as salsas and sambas, which have layers of percussion, blaring horns and an infectious sense of style. A related style to salsa is the bossa nova, a cool, laid-back style that crossed dance music with jazz. With the exception of tejano and mariachi, which is folk and pop based, most Latin music is defined by its strong rhythms.","songs":[{"id":"mSrVBTeb7a9","name":"Despacito (Remix)","artist":"Cfo90689"},{"id":"ckg8df6323","name":"Hero","artist":"UgO9ad40"},{"id":"b1sHSbf5ef","name":"Angelina","artist":"5CU7a6cc"},{"id":"mQ4s1v7f3b4","name":"Me and You","artist":"dnyf3b27a"},{"id":"bCk7tmb4579c","name":"Great Morning","artist":"Gpe92189"},{"id":"b4BFWab3a7","name":"I Don't Miss You Anymore","artist":"bwgYe403b"},{"id":"8GoadEff3fb","name":"Can't Remember to Forget You","artist":"5DQ944f2"},{"id":"ckg9Ke6fa9","name":"It's Not Good-Bye","artist":"4Cd8b79d"},{"id":"b1pRdKW42d02","name":"Every Breath You Take","artist":"bCRXe9e33"},{"id":"b1pb4cadde","name":"Crazy","artist":"VEmce8ec"},{"id":"xLrsYqf6237","name":"If I'd Known feat.

The style grew out of an attempt on the part of Latin musicians in New York City to expand the reach of their music beyond the local Latin community and into the wider mainstream American society.","songs":[{"id":"b3Jvuc0dc1","name":"I Wouldn't Change A Thing","artist":"4OR54cfc"},{"id":"RJdR587f9","name":"Que Me Alcance la Vida","artist":"baJu14bf5"},{"id":"QiNE8c79e","name":"Panama City","artist":"bO0S2252d"},{"id":"mTjFxB92b6d","name":"MÍA","artist":"bC7CZcVb7dde"},{"id":"b4ajSb6d30","name":"Acid","artist":"dQVH497b2"},{"id":"U7VQPJ25c8f","name":"Cariño","artist":"yiuthY13cec"},{"id":"cgOpFe3445","name":"Get out of My Way","artist":"VO7ba51c"},{"id":"enkfP2ee6c","name":"Jungle Fever","artist":"Xjfd011a"},{"id":"b3Rhxa4ee1","name":"Guaracha","artist":"buQ5e5fd1"},{"id":"N8Wt6d459","name":"Cinturita","artist":"4Ph66619"},{"id":"mSvRoI5f919","name":"Brazil Groove","artist":"8HID08f91a0"}],"albums":[{"id":"yhVQOrd3db2","name":"X 100PRE","artist":"bC7CZcVb7dde"},{"id":"jf1Oa2d19","name":"Comin' at Ya!","artist":"4OR54cfc"},{"id":"jz0Ydda4a","name":"Mañana","artist":"baJu14bf5"},{"id":"n1qE18dcc","name":"Tropidelico","artist":"bO0S2252d"},{"id":"jfC6c80d2","name":"Acid","artist":"dQVH497b2"},{"id":"fnrV86b61","name":"De Viaje","artist":"baJu14bf5"},{"id":"9cEOnsf541d","name":"Cariño","artist":"yiuthY13cec"},{"id":"iQ6Ba87e7","name":"Latino con Soul","artist":"VO7ba51c"},{"id":"eTxL86b65","name":"The Good, The Bad, The Ugly","artist":"buQ5e5fd1"},{"id":"eXKd5d25a","name":"Jungle Fever","artist":"Xjfd011a"},{"id":"nnkIhM62629","name":"Solo de Mi","artist":"bC7CZcVb7dde"},{"id":"C2uI479a6","name":"Champagne","artist":"4Ph66619"}],"artists":[{"id":"4Ph66619","name":"Eddie Palmieri"},{"id":"baJu14bf5","name":"Sin Bandera"},{"id":"buQwef6f9","name":"Willie Bobo"},{"id":"UQcd3dde","name":"Hermeto Pascoal"},{"id":"Vgnd1ca4","name":"Joe Bataan"},{"id":"4OR54cfc","name":"Coke Escovedo"},{"id":"nmSsTo5b755","name":"icbm mail"},{"id":"buQ5e5fd1","name":"Willie Colón"},{"id":"UP0b64f1","name":"Rubén Blades"},{"id":"dQWz4923b","name":"Pucho & His Latin Soul Brothers"},{"id":"cJ0D3284e","name":"Los Zafiros"},{"id":"Xjfd011a","name":"Chakachas"}]},{"type":"style","id":"340","name":"拉丁摇滚 Latin Rock","description":"Latin Rock(Rock en español) is the Spanish-language rock music.

In the music realm, this can be heard with many different genres, like reggae, (which later led to dancehall), rap/hip-hop, reggaeton, and Latin rap. The latter form of music has been a hit especially in countries with a large number of migrators to the United States. For example, Mexico has a growing hip hop scene with groups such as Control Machete, Cartel De Santa, and Molotov. Similarly, the movement has spread to Puerto Rico, a country where many of its residents have moved to New York, Miami and Chicago over the years. Latin rap was jumpstarted by a wave of rappers that included Ruben DJ and Vico C. Ruben DJ's hit, La Escuela, (The School) and Vico C's hit, La Recta Final, (The End of the Road) received considerable radio time during the late 1980s. In addition to Latin rap in Puerto Rico developing around the same time as early American hip-hop, and rap and reggae simultaneously having a substantial impact on each other, all three genres (rap, Latin rap, and reggae/dancehall) relate a certain message to their respective audiences. Puerto Rican rap emerged as a form of cultural and social protest within the Puerto Rican context. This is similar to the way American and Jamaican youth used rap and reggae/dancehall as a means to communicate their feelings on social, cultural, and political issues. In essence, Puerto Rican rap became the voice of Puerto Rican youth like dancehall and rap music are methods of expression for their Jamaican and lower-class U.S. youth counterparts.\nLatin rap has also surfaced in the UK with a group called Cultura Londres who list Eric Bobo of Cypress Hill as one of their members.\nIt should also be noted that a number of East Coast rappers that have been usually identified as African American have parentage from a country that speaks Spanish or Portuguese, usually Puerto Rico, The Dominican Republic, and Panama.

Some rock bands started to use unusual instruments such as maracas and quenas. In the late 1960s, artists like Santana started using a different technique to make rock music; by incorporating influences of Latin jazz. Its sound was incorporated by young Latino-players in the US, as an answer to the rock en Español movement in Hispanic America and Spain led by bands like Héroes del Silencio, Soda Stereo, Caifanes or Los Prisioneros.\n\nIn the early 1990s, it was used by Mexican bands such as Maldita Vecindad and Café Tacuba, they were accepted on the Latino circuit in the US, especially by the Mexican community. Subsequently, experimental musician Lynda Thomas earned recognition and commercial success with alternative music in the same decade.\n\nWith the passage of time and many musical styles in the US-Latino, Latin alternative has become as diverse as the rock music genre itself. Today, many music journalists and fans regard Latin alternative as a subgenre of rock en Español, and like rock en Español, it may be further divided into more specific genres of music.\nThe most known event of Latin alternative is the Latin Alternative Music Conference (LAMC) that every year gathers a large number of bands from all over the Americas and Spain. It was first held in Los Angeles but two years ago the new host city was changed to New York. The 2009 event featured artists from across the Americas including Argentina's Juana Molina, Puerto Rican hip-hop and reggaeton outfit Calle 13, Colombian group Bomba Estéreo, Brazilian singer-songwriter Curumin and Mexico's Natalia Lafourcade, and was profiled along with the wider Latin alternative scene in an article in The New York Times.","songs":[{"id":"ckQrmf4160","name":"La Camisa Negra ","artist":"dczS38b95"},{"id":"xLrXnI9f708","name":"El Estuche ","artist":"bMgK23ea4"},{"id":"R1944e783","name":"Me Gustas Tu","artist":"dg0u39db7"},{"id":"mTq4Ur6a4c8","name":"切剮剌","artist":"nmS0Lw70622"},{"id":"d6Du5279e4","name":"Limón y Sal ","artist":"bwnifa7c1"},{"id":"xLyVtx9b188","name":"Guajira (I Love U 2 Much)","artist":"bOhF201ff"},{"id":"8GcFaZfa156","name":"Bombay","artist":"WLmd5d2a"},{"id":"8Gp8irf9757","name":"Overnight Success (Napster Live Version)","artist":"43G5b8dd"},{"id":"mSrpFGef354","name":"Freedom Is Free","artist":"bfNwfcv3107a"},{"id":"en2pO3372c","name":"Autobanda","artist":"XNQda4df"},{"id":"b6Ipj9fe15","name":"DJ","artist":"bzx2e3412"},{"id":"clHBqf5f77","name":"Vos No Confiaste","artist":"cEc42d28b"}],"albums":[{"id":"eVhp4bf48","name":"Mi Sangre","artist":"dczS38b95"},{"id":"885N3d1fd","name":"Proxima Estacion: Esperanza","artist":"dg0u39db7"},{"id":"nnlJ2793818","name":"切剮剌(單曲版)","artist":"nmS0Lw70622"},{"id":"jgFzb486a","name":"MTV Unplugged","artist":"bwnifa7c1"},{"id":"yhOSfPb1aec","name":"Mis Planes Son Amarte","artist":"dczS38b95"},{"id":"oVPued44d","name":"Follow Me","artist":"bOhF201ff"},{"id":"xMVTZ0a2423","name":"Loco de Amor","artist":"dczS38b95"},{"id":"yhOI3p11c55","name":"Freedom Is Free","artist":"bfNwfcv3107a"},{"id":"oqPPeb0e7","name":"Pop Negro","artist":"WLmd5d2a"},{"id":"fgXy77c3e","name":"Money Pa' Que","artist":"bzx2e3412"},{"id":"C4r346c9c","name":"Fijate Bien","artist":"dczS38b95"},{"id":"jmiU12821","name":"Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 3","artist":"XNQda4df"}],"artists":[{"id":"VELb65c8","name":"Soda Stereo"},{"id":"XRbda2f0","name":"Maldita Vecindad"},{"id":"ck1UPh88b3e","name":"Su乐团"}]},{"type":"style","id":"198","name":"萨尔萨 Salsa","description":"萨尔萨，一种结合了古巴黑人音乐、美国爵士乐以及南美民间音乐的舞曲音乐。40年代起源于美国，经过50至60年代的演变和发展，于70年代中期形成流行高峰。萨尔萨的节奏乐器仍以拉美打击乐器为主，如沙球、响棒、康加鼓、邦戈鼓等。基本节奏型与曼波、恰恰相似，但萨尔萨中的一种两小节节奏型却独具特色：4/4拍，× × ×× | 0 ×× 0 0 |。传统的萨尔萨音乐，经常由一个不断反复的固定动机构成的曼波段落而组成。salsa乐风及舞蹈百花齐放席卷了整个美洲各国，更沿烧全世界。 Salsa is one of the most dynamic musical styles to come out of the western hemisphere. \"Salsa\" means \"sauce,\" but the term should not be taken to mean simply hot and vibrant, nor should the music be regarded as such. Salsa is a term much like the word \"swing\" as it was applied to the jazz swing bands of the 1930s and 1940s. It describes a feeling that covers a wide range of emotions and musical expression. Salsa is not always fast-paced and vivid — it can be slow and romantic or anything in between. The basic sound of salsa was intact before the term was applied to the music. In the 1940s and '50s, the Cuban sonero Arsenio Rodrigues, a blind tres player, became the dominant trendsetter in Latin music. His ensemble included a piano, a second trumpet, sometimes a saxophone, and an expanded rhythm section that included timbales, conga, and a cowbell. Instrumental parts were standardized and tight pre-set compositions were used. Salsa is also characterized by syncopated bass patterns. The ensembles of Rodrigues became the standard for Cuban dance bands and formed the basis for salsa. Salsa is influenced by many Latin musical forms, like the Puerto Rican plenas, the Dominican merengue, and the Colombian cumbia, but its backbone is the Cuban son. The primary difference between salsa and Cuban music is that salsa has largely developed outside of Cuba. Although salseros are found in most Latin American countries, it is primarily associated with Puerto Rican musicians. The term \"salsa\" did not come into use until the 1960s. It was applied to the music of Tito Puente and others who had been playing the music for at least 25 years. The term was made popular primarily by Jerry Masucci, the New York-based founder of Fania Records (the largest producer of Latin dance music recordings until the 1980s). The best years for salsa were the 1970s, when Latin Americans were looking back to their roots. This showed in the attitude of salsa musicians looking for stylistic purity. They did so by using smaller band sizes like that of the Cuban conjunto, consisting of a rhythm section with a front line of three to five horns and one or two singers. Although salsa is a Cuban-based musical form (and a commercial form as well), it has served as a rallying point for Puerto Ricans and as an icon of pan-Latin consciousness. Nonetheless, salsa is still a form of dance music subject to the whims of public tastes, and it suffered a decline in popularity in the 1980s as the Dominican merengue became fashionable. Salsa survived in all its dynamism but in a more diffuse environment, as other styles of Latin music become popular on a mass level. — Keith Johnson","songs":[{"id":"bBnczd6697","name":"Siempre Me Quedará","artist":"cF5U31f28"},{"id":"f7TqH432a5","name":"I Need to Know","artist":"dQng4441a"},{"id":"L6IS58a13","name":"Indispensable","artist":"5EL753a1"},{"id":"b4jpEd2e07","name":"Por una Cabeza","artist":"VGUc46f5"},{"id":"b5dVwdb9a4","name":"Saturday Night","artist":"6Du4ffa0"},{"id":"gnFzk49c5c","name":"Music to Watch Girls By","artist":"buQwef6f9"},{"id":"b37Fm9d3f0","name":"Listen Here","artist":"4Ph66619"},{"id":"OveE57793","name":"Tu Belleza","artist":"VGAdd674"},{"id":"OhKm59f74","name":"Por Que Te Quiero Tanto","artist":"5Gk62729"},{"id":"mQ3qTDaf7b4","name":"Ay No","artist":"dQVH497b2"},{"id":"b1pdg96e9e","name":"Mal Acostumbrado (Mal Acostumado)","artist":"VEmce8ec"},{"id":"mQ70D682ff2","name":"Esperanza","artist":"LNZ5a149"}],"albums":[{"id":"iXAvbaf34","name":"Marc Anthony","artist":"dQng4441a"},{"id":"vIJ12c0a8","name":"Street Signs","artist":"6Du4ffa0"},{"id":"iTiI13d40","name":"Mi Tiempo","artist":"5EL753a1"},{"id":"iSLM9e455","name":"Caribe Gardel","artist":"VGUc46f5"},{"id":"zKk2322c5","name":"Contra la Corriente","artist":"dQng4441a"},{"id":"Qp7Py3b96e","name":"3.0","artist":"dQng4441a"},{"id":"yilXqDb8c13","name":"Hope","artist":"b1CSa5B3d271"},{"id":"jfuxd10be","name":"Listen Here!","artist":"4Ph66619"},{"id":"eT1zdc0ac","name":"Juicy","artist":"buQwef6f9"},{"id":"kiIrba410","name":"El Camino","artist":"LNZ5a149"},{"id":"iTjH14211","name":"Rumba Baby Rumba","artist":"VFAda428"},{"id":"iSRLb9ad0","name":"Hoy, Manana y Siempre","artist":"VGAdd674"}],"artists":[{"id":"dQng4441a","name":"Marc Anthony"},{"id":"LNZ5a149","name":"Salsa Celtica"},{"id":"5EL753a1","name":"Chayanne"},{"id":"4Ps87662","name":"Mongo Santamaria"},{"id":"bsZwe85c2","name":"Tito Puente"},{"id":"4Ph66619","name":"Eddie Palmieri"},{"id":"dQVH497b2","name":"Ray Barretto"},{"id":"UP5c1680","name":"Cachao"},{"id":"URcc3a73","name":"Pérez Prado"},{"id":"4OL90e75","name":"Celia Cruz"},{"id":"VGdc4059","name":"Juan Luis Guerra"},{"id":"6Du4ffa0","name":"Ozomatli"}]},{"type":"style","id":"2148","name":"探戈 Tango","description":"暂无","songs":[{"id":"cndsCe9266","name":"Libertango","artist":"1X741c0"},{"id":"bBnczd6697","name":"Siempre Me Quedará","artist":"cF5U31f28"},{"id":"RNta4f081","name":"L' Été Indien","artist":"dWU46c737"},{"id":"b6ZSCd556a","name":"Last Tango in Paris","artist":"ZJuc3da7"},{"id":"xL8LYEc8b6c","name":"一步之遥-化装舞会","artist":"dpqJ0Cb8eac"},{"id":"xLqOola7030","name":"Badinerie","artist":"4G88c0d1"},{"id":"cg5uhfd36a","name":"Prologue (Tango Apasionado)","artist":"Tqg15224"},{"id":"b1pVMVK3ec3d","name":"Por Una Cabeza","artist":"eGsY60c23"},{"id":"bqvcAc492df6","name":"Pa' Bailar (Instrumental Album Version)","artist":"H3x84308"},{"id":"cqw7Efd241","name":"Libertango","artist":"WeU99a9d"},{"id":"8Gasrde2954","name":"August","artist":"bgv39fa33"},{"id":"xLvATBd04d3","name":"Por Una Cabeza","artist":"Fe55029c"}],"albums":[{"id":"4uta3b719","name":"Soul of the Tango: The Music o...","artist":"1X741c0"},{"id":"nBXIfc9ba","name":"Canzone Della Strada","artist":"dWU46c737"},{"id":"0h8j338d8","name":"La Revancha del Tango","artist":"ZJuc3da7"},{"id":"fByB8bffa","name":"The Tango Project Orientango","artist":"bglUa6dc7"},{"id":"nBXJfd4f6","name":"Mocca Flor","artist":"dWU46c737"},{"id":"jzOKd553e","name":"Tango Bitter Sweet","artist":"dWU46c737"},{"id":"wA2l2882e","name":"Bach","artist":"4G88c0d1"},{"id":"jSl8983f8","name":"Gala De Caras","artist":"bgv39fa33"},{"id":"m2OBlX7d132","name":"魔鬼的浪漫曲","artist":"dpqJ0Cb8eac"},{"id":"KoG84a75","name":"Tango (Soundtrack from the Mot...","artist":"2Yt56cf3"},{"id":"fHWM53da0","name":"Mar Dulce","artist":"H3x84308"},{"id":"fMuf629c4","name":"Tango 3.0","artist":"ZJuc3da7"}],"artists":[{"id":"Tqg15224","name":"Astor Piazzolla"},{"id":"dWU46c737","name":"Quadro Nuevo"},{"id":"4G88c0d1","name":"Richard Galliano"},{"id":"dAbh66994","name":"Gidon Kremer"},{"id":"dpqJ0Cb8eac","name":"自由探戈乐团"},{"id":"SXob7797","name":"Gerry Mulligan"},{"id":"ba1Uc5e60","name":"Hugo Diaz"},{"id":"eGsY60c23","name":"The Tango Project"},{"id":"2Yt56cf3","name":"Lalo Schifrin"},{"id":"H3x84308","name":"Bajofondo"},{"id":"7zV8f1da","name":"Kronos Quartet"},{"id":"bf0kdc3ff","name":"Carel Kraayenhof"}]},{"type":"style","id":"212","name":"热带 Tropical","description":"热带本质是一个包罗万象的现代拉丁音乐，产生于加勒比海-如古巴，波多黎各和多米尼加共和国（但不是墨西哥内陆地区）。萨尔萨、梅伦格、坎比亚是在热带音乐中最流行的节奏。Tropical is essentially a catch-all term for modernized Latin music emanating from the Caribbean — places like Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic (though not the inland areas of Mexico).

Cantonese Opera","description":"粤剧，又称“大戏”或者“广东大戏”是融汇明清以来流入广东的海盐、弋阳、昆山、梆子等诸腔并吸收珠江三角洲的民间音乐所形成的以梆子（京剧称西皮）、二黄为主的我国南方一大剧种，主要流行于广东、广西、台湾和港澳。\n\n粤剧源自南戏，自明朝嘉靖年间开始在广东、广西出现，是揉合唱做念打、乐师配乐、戏台服饰、抽象形体等等的表演艺术。最初演出的语言是中原音韵，又称为戏棚官话。19世纪40年代中，广府戏已从开埠后的香港，传到东南亚的新加坡、马来西亚了。以后，星马的粤剧也颇兴盛，故新加坡有“粤剧第二故乡”之称。广府戏到了外国，西人称之为Cantonese Opera，到了清朝末期，文化人为了方便宣扬革命而把演唱语言改为粤语，使广州人更容易明白。\n\n粤剧演员的表演工艺分为四大基本类别：唱、做、念、打。 唱是指唱功，配合不同的角色有各自不同演唱的方式，包括平喉及子喉。平喉是平常说话的声调，一般男性角色小生就是采用平喉演出。子喉是比平喉调子高了八度，常常以假音来扮演女性角色。除了以音阶来分类，也会以声音特色来分类。大喉是使用粗犷声音。同时，粤剧也会吸收不同的地方的独特唱腔，例如来自福建的广东南音、木鱼、广东的本地民谣粤讴及板眼。\n\n粤曲唱腔音乐的基本特色是板腔类，即梆子和二黄，俗称“梆黄”，也即是和京剧的“皮黄”同类，所以粤剧也属于南北路的戏曲，即有南路“二黄”唱腔和北路“梆子”唱腔。粤曲的板腔原是由外省传入，是由诗赞类的齐言滚唱方式发展出来，后来节以鼓板，由不同板式引发唱腔的变化，故称“板式变化体”。\n\n粤剧名列于2006年5月20日公布的第一批518项国家级非物质文化遗产名录之内。2009年9月30日，粤剧获联合国教科文组织肯定，列入人类非物质文化遗产名录。","songs":[{"id":"xLqJiY9c648","name":"香夭","artist":"biUo9eb6d"},{"id":"xL13lSb9e1b","name":"帝女花之香夭","artist":"vz4k293ea"},{"id":"Zmie0fd6","name":"恭喜你","artist":"c2a44b5f"},{"id":"6b81268","name":"客途秋恨","artist":"lL34c35"},{"id":"JANRvj25085","name":"彩云追月","artist":"blauce0c9"},{"id":"b1j1e567d","name":"并蒂花","artist":"fL9b6d57"},{"id":"mQ33RN91195","name":"大牌档小唱","artist":"mK4p48c071"},{"id":"xL2LlAd2504","name":"昭君出塞

Chinese Quyi","description":"曲艺是中华民族各种说唱艺术的统称，它是由民间口头文学和歌唱艺术经过长期发展演变形成的一种独特的艺术形式。以“说、唱”为主要的艺术表现手段。说的如小品、相声、评书、评话；唱的如京韵大鼓、单弦牌子曲、扬州清曲、东北大鼓、温州大鼓、胶东大鼓、湖北大鼓等等；似说似唱的如山东快书、快板书、锣鼓书、萍乡春锣、四川金钱板等；又说又唱的如山东琴书、徐州琴书、恩施扬琴、武乡琴书、安徽琴书、贵州琴书、云南扬琴等；又说又唱又舞的走唱如二人转、十不闲莲花落、宁波走书、凤阳花鼓、车灯、商花鼓等。\n\n中国曲艺发展的历史源远流长，早在古代，我国民间的说故事、讲笑话，宫廷中俳优的弹唱歌舞、滑稽表演，都含有曲艺的艺术因素。到了唐代，讲说市人小说和向俗众宣讲出现，大曲和民间曲调的流行，使说话伎艺、歌唱伎艺兴盛起来，自此，曲艺作为一种独立的艺术形式开始形成。宋明以来，曲艺以小说、演义形式表现在民间，如日中天。\n\n曲艺表演的简便易行，使它对生活的反映快捷。曲目、书目的内容多以短小精悍为主，因而曲艺演员通常能自编，自导，自演。与戏剧演员相比，曲艺演员所肩负的导演职能，尤为明显。比如一个曲目、书目，或一个相声段子，在表演过程中故事情节的结构、场面的安排、场景的转换、气氛的渲染、人物的出没、人物心理的刻划、语言的铺排、声调的把握、节奏的快慢等等，无一不是由曲艺演员根据叙事或抒情的需要，根据对听众最佳接受效果的判断，来对说或唱进行统筹安排，进行调度，导演出一个个令听众心醉的精彩节目。\n\n曲艺以说、唱为艺术表现的主要手段，因而它是诉诸人们听觉的艺术。也就是说曲艺是通过说、唱刺激听众的听觉来驱动听众的形象思维，在听众形象思维构成的意象中与演员共同完成艺术创造。曲艺表演可以在舞台上进行，也可划地为台随处表演，因而曲艺听众的思维与戏剧观众相比，不受舞台框架的限制，曲艺所说、唱的内容比戏剧具有更大的时间和空间的自由。为了把听众天马行空的形象思维规范到由说、唱营造的艺术天地之中，曲艺演员对听众反应的聆察更其迫切，也更为细致，因而他与听众的关系，比之戏剧演员更为密切。\n\n不管是说书的，还是唱戏的，都能把中国历代传奇故事等娓娓道来，这就是曲艺的特殊表现手法。","songs":[{"id":"mQ75bW8ba47","name":"返场精粹

Taiwan Aboriginal","description":"台湾族群之多、文化之富是世界许多岛屿中无能出其右的。其中最具特色的无非是原住民音乐的丰富性与多样性。\n\n台湾原住民音乐独具特色，例如布农族的著名的八部合音、多声部合唱，泰雅族与太鲁阁族的多金属簧口簧琴、阿美族的自由对位式复音合唱等。已故民族学家史惟亮说：“如同不经琢磨的宝石，原住民音乐量的丰富，超过人口占百分之九十八强的汉族民问音乐，甚至量之丰富包罗了整个欧洲的歌唱型式。”同时台湾民谣中，原住民民谣的数量之多是惊人的。\n\n泰雅族在唱法上有吟诵唱法及民歌唱法。歌唱方式有独唱及合唱，传统歌谣不多。音阶有三音(mi, sol, la )、四音(re, mi, sol,la) 和五音(sol, la, do, re, mi)三种音阶。\n\n赛夏族除了一般所唱的歌之外，矮灵祭的祭歌最为重要。一般所唱的歌为数很少，流传不多，可能很少人去唱的缘故。矮灵祭的歌，由于每二年一次祭典中，由集体一起歌唱，且祭歌需要很长的时间吟唱，所以在族人中广受流传。除迎神歌之外，其余都伴有舞蹈。而祭歌歌词内容最具文学价值。\n\n布农族的音乐大都以自然泛音的do, mi, sol , do 所构成，族人中合唱甚为普遍。大小三度、完全四度、五度、八度构成了合唱的和声。布农族许多歌谣中都非常类似，但和声甚为族人所重视。祈祷小米丰收歌pasibutbut这世界唯一仅有的特殊唱法，是布农族最具特色的歌谣。\n\n邹族歌谣中包括有单音性歌谣与和音唱法，单音性歌谣都以独唱和齐唱方式出现。和音唱法有和音合唱及部分和音唱法两种，前者较多。和声以三度、五度最为常见。邹族可说是多产「祭歌」的民族，其中极为重要的祭仪mayasvi 就包含了迎神曲、送神曲、战歌、历史颂、勇士颂等祭歌。\n\n阿美族的歌谣丰富又富有变化，歌谣中旋律的变化和音乐形式的多样性反映了阿美族热情开朗的性格。唱法上包含吟诵、对唱、领唱与应答及卡农唱法。歌词可以是针对特定的对象和目的而吟唱，亦有以不同的对象、生活、工作、人物等作即兴的唱喝。音阶包含五音和无半音五音音阶，临时音也经常出现在其中。\n\n卑南族歌谣抒情、流畅、高亢、悠远最为常见。由于重视团体，歌谣常于生活、工作中配合节奏性的旋律由族人作整体性的歌诵和舞蹈。祭典歌较属男性所唱。唱法上常有吟诵、对唱及领唱应答的唱法。\n\n排湾族是一个出产情歌最为丰富的民族。旋律一样的歌谣，歌词可以因人情感之抒发而有不同的内容，以即兴、自由、隐喻的方式表达个人深沉的爱意。歌唱有独唱、领唱与回应及合唱等方式。合唱中常出现二度、四度、八度及杜农唱法。\n\n鲁凯族的特征是单音性与多音性歌谣。单音性主要表现在独唱、齐唱两种。多音性歌谣则多以持续低音唱法着称。独唱旋律出现于上声部，持续低音合唱则行于下声部。情歌亦不少出现在鲁凯族歌谣裡面，婚礼中新娘祝福歌最具特色。\n\n雅美族的生活大都以捕鱼、农耕、放牧为生，特别以捕鱼为重。所以歌谣中不乏与祭有关的歌，如船祭之歌、下水礼之歌、粟丰收祭之歌等等。其他与生活有关的，如工作之歌、划船之歌、捕捉飞鱼之歌、主屋落成歌、捡柴歌、思念之歌及摇篮歌等都非常生活化。曲式类型不多，音阶仅有一、二个，歌的类型常因歌词的变化而改变。歌并没有特定的歌词。\n\n有人担心随着新旧时代的更替，加上年迈长者的离世，原住民音乐也可能因此而逐渐流失，原住民民谣也为此失去了传承的希望。但是，从民谣的生存环境来看，部落了依然存在，原住民音乐会随着部落延续下来。\n\n时代不断的改变，原住民音乐也间接受到影响，原本部落的生活，以农为生，处处耳闻狩猎、耕种与砍伐木材的歌词。社会转型之后，包含着许多有关织布歌、竹竿舞的轻松悠闲歌词，现在也不复存在，虽然这些民谣随着环境变了，但是这些改变的民谣，也是从传统延续来的，只是它随着不同环境的改变，产生不同的变化罢了。","songs":[{"id":"fOny527be","name":"海洋","artist":"j72cc69"},{"id":"xLsxMya89e1","name":"一朵花","artist":"blMfd6964"},{"id":"8dvD4274d","name":"流浪记","artist":"iphea2ba"},{"id":"mQOY9R525f9","name":"姊妹亲爱歌","artist":"ueF379d0"},{"id":"7FB5ba60","name":"老人饮酒歌","artist":"cjL414cb"},{"id":"blE6a3e3c","name":"泥娃娃","artist":"cW18480d"},{"id":"fN3D6b80a","name":"匆匆","artist":"BSa7125"},{"id":"oq7Hfcad9","name":"月光","artist":"baPf9575"},{"id":"jkLTb36dc","name":"望春风","artist":"dxe92048"},{"id":"8GfP5Fe39e1","name":"赛德克‧巴莱之看见彩虹","artist":"yhD0Xiaf81e"},{"id":"U5SSCW27d96","name":"请为我开门","artist":"v1YV2778f"},{"id":"kcopdf25e","name":"不自由","artist":"e3Ddf6e0"}],"albums":[{"id":"kv7M9e56e","name":"大武山蓝调","artist":"BSa7125"},{"id":"S41a255","name":"海洋","artist":"j72cc69"},{"id":"dap78a90","name":"匆匆","artist":"BSa7125"},{"id":"ewUa7156","name":"泥娃娃","artist":"cW18480d"},{"id":"D5AW46ff3","name":"MATZKA","artist":"blMfd6964"},{"id":"cX9865c7","name":"生命之环","artist":"cjL414cb"},{"id":"koLf9535","name":"野火春风","artist":"iphea2ba"},{"id":"by51eaa4b","name":"勇士与稻穗-陈建年&巴奈

Music","description":"西藏一直到上个世纪50年代，由于西藏社会一直处于封闭状态，其音乐也长时间停留于固有的传统形式。从分类上看，音乐理论界一般把西藏的传统音乐分为四种类型：宫廷音乐、民间音乐、宗教音乐、戏剧音乐。此外还存一种三分法，就是将喜剧音乐归类为民间音乐。 \n\n西藏的宫廷音乐，一般特指西藏在上世纪中叶的布达拉宫供云乐舞之音乐，也包括各地寺院大活佛宫廷内的供云乐舞之音乐。\n\n民间音乐在西藏传统音乐中占有较大的比重，无论从品种、数摄上看，还是从内容之丰富程度上讲，无论从覆盖面上看，还是从表演频率上讲，它都居西藏音乐四大类之首。从体裁上分，民间音乐又可分为歌舞类、民歌类、劳动歌曲类、说唱类和器乐类五种。\n\n 和平解放以前，西藏是一个政教合一、几乎全民信教的社会，藏传佛教占领普整个社会意识领域，并支配普人们的行为。因此，宗教音乐在西藏社会中占有至尊的地位，因而也得到了长足的发展。西藏的宗教音乐也称寺院音乐，一般可分为苯教音乐和藏传佛教音乐两种。藏传佛教音乐又有显宗与密宗之分。从形式上看，有味经曲、仪轨曲、密宗金刚舞曲。宗教音乐的表演是在宗教节日中进行的，因为，就本质而言，宗教音乐就是宗教活动本身的一部分内容或一个组成部分。不论是咏经曲、仪轨曲、或者是密宗金刚曲，它们都是宗教本身的一个组成部分一个密不可分的内容。因此，哪里有宗教活动哪里就有宗教音乐，从这个意义上讲宗教音乐的分布就仅次于民间音乐。\n\n    宗教乐器也称“法器”。一般有“铜钦”（法号）：它是在大型仪式中使用：甲林是一种起源于汉地的吹奏乐器．常常也是在大型仪式中使用：“苏呐”：是一种起源于阿拉伯一带的乐器常用于各种仪式中长柄鼓或铃鼓：常用于护法神殿及攘解仪礼中：大锣或铜锣：主要是由于宣报僧侣们集合时间的；白海螺：它是宗教仪轨中的重要伴奏乐器之一；大海螺：它主要用于具有高级特点的密教仪轨中，在萨迦巴、宁玛巴和噶举巴中该乐器一般仅用于颂赞歌中：大擦：它主要用于与恶神有关的仪轨中：胫骨号：它是一种广泛使用的吹奏乐器之一在召神仪式中必不可少单旗它是一种来自汉地的吉祥物云锣：它常由九锣组成同样也是一件吉祥物。\n\n西藏的戏剧艺术主要有藏戏、昌都戏、门巴戏等。藏戏也称藏剧，它是西藏戏剧艺术的总名称。从这个意义上讲昌都戏、门巴戏都是属于藏戏的范畴，是藏戏的几个分支，只是这些戏的唱腔、表演形式等与卫藏地区的藏戏相比有着明显的差异而已，因而也就得了上述名称。藏戏是藏族人民喜闻乐见的艺术品种，其流传广泛，包括藏区的城镇、乡村、家喻户晓。在和平解放前西藏各地有20多个民间的藏戏班子，其中，最有影响的有“琼日沃钦”藏戏团、“杰卡曲宗”藏戏团、“香巴”藏戏团、“觉木隆”藏戏团。（知识来源：古曲网）","songs":[{"id":"xL0mZic5f2c","name":"莲师七句祈请文与心咒","artist":"x703a7d4878"},{"id":"bf018994d7d7","name":"玛吉阿米","artist":"Mcy71121"},{"id":"Tymx59de8","name":"Happiness

Wagner and Debussy can easily be classified as avant-garde relevant to their time but the term did not enter familiar usage until the advent of Stockhausen.","songs":[{"id":"U5PYAJ2c568","name":"Special","artist":"Cm1v4b19b"},{"id":"U5RoBl266b4","name":"癌","artist":"xLLCPdd5f3b"},{"id":"mQ4TFE71d54","name":"Blanc","artist":"AWO4c5d2"},{"id":"cpHJme946a","name":"H in New England","artist":"Eeh90b39"},{"id":"xLval5af958","name":"Familiar","artist":"bgsPcba58"},{"id":"b5Jxi9966c","name":"Sing Along","artist":"XXI9f031"},{"id":"cggEof7b15","name":"Heroes","artist":"2Dm503c2"},{"id":"chtAyf7638","name":"Lost Rivers","artist":"VDfaaf4d"},{"id":"b4IaD98aef","name":"Ghost","artist":"cj7p2a1b8"},{"id":"b5HyOd1290","name":"Partus","artist":"bxUCf6592"},{"id":"eNXlW39fd1","name":"Vitamin C","artist":"bIGr252eb"},{"id":"b6IQFe02e8","name":"Korg","artist":"bzyc1c676"}],"albums":[{"id":"vMN8Z1a0d4","name":"Six60","artist":"Cm1v4b19b"},{"id":"eHEW76e6f","name":"Lost Rivers","artist":"VDfaaf4d"},{"id":"jg1da0c68","name":"Colma","artist":"cj7p2a1b8"},{"id":"foqp9e0d3","name":"Nocturne Impalpable","artist":"AWO4c5d2"},{"id":"ePLIz924886","name":"癌","artist":"xLLCPdd5f3b"},{"id":"DJRT4512d","name":"Felt","artist":"bgsPcba58"},{"id":"4rT3547d1","name":"Night Before Death of Sampling...","artist":"bzyc1c676"},{"id":"jDFNdd3a0","name":"24 Postcards in Full Colour","artist":"Eeh90b39"},{"id":"yhUv909b5bc","name":"JOHN DOE","artist":"nn9ok84f183"},{"id":"bC7hCqG49516","name":"山水清音图","artist":"bBY32965"},{"id":"g8Ds766c2","name":"52赫兹","artist":"iU5d148ad"},{"id":"bdoc96fa9","name":"\"Heroes\"","artist":"2Dm503c2"}],"artists":[{"id":"bBY32965","name":"窦唯"},{"id":"WoSd3bd2","name":"Ólafur Arnalds"},{"id":"EEA78266","name":"戸川純"},{"id":"2Fg4d0f3","name":"Brian Eno"},{"id":"bIGr252eb","name":"Can"},{"id":"6oc7d1a1","name":"The American Dollar"},{"id":"ciRD27262","name":"Frank Zappa"},{"id":"fBHaad86","name":"龚琳娜"},{"id":"Tw0a54f8","name":"Current 93"},{"id":"6L1827b3","name":"The Knife"},{"id":"3OL7516f","name":"灰野敬二"},{"id":"hUUNL839b8","name":"艾热"}]},{"type":"style","id":"700","name":"自由即兴 Free Improvisation","description":"自由即兴音乐代表了前卫音乐人对彻底的、不妥协姿态的创作自由追求的顶点。即兴意味着毫无准备之下的演绎，意味着要在当时当地即时创作音乐。\n即兴不是新鲜事物：古典音乐作曲家（如Mozart）便是技艺高超的即兴表演者。自由即兴音乐则让音乐艺人随心所欲，置任何规条于不顾，节奏、和声、旋律，甚至对乐器自身的物理完整性的尊重，全都被粉碎。“自由即兴”表演者通过他的乐器和演奏传达出自己的创造力，与可能给人的仿佛印象相比，自由即兴演绎实际上要艰难许多，它要求大量的音乐和心理上的训练，因为音乐人必须达到一种高水平的专注力，一种将自己赤裸裸地表现在观众面前的能力，如果不是单独表演（也不想被孤立的话），他还需要聆听他人的即兴，以便与之互动。\n\n\nFree improvisation represents the culmination of the avant-gardist musician¹s quest for complete, uncompromised freedom. To improvise means to perform without preparation, to make music on the spot. Improvising is nothing new: classical composers like Mozart were accomplished improvisers. But free improvisation lets the musician do whatever he wants, regardless of any rule. Rhythm, harmony, melody, even respect for the physical integrity of the instrument itself (preparations and home-built instruments are often used) are shattered. The free improviser channels his creative energy through his instrument and plays. A lot harder than it may seem, free improvising requires extensive musical and psychological training, as the musician must attain a high level of concentration, an ability to metaphorically strip naked in front of the audience, and if he is not performing alone, to listen to the other improvisers in order to interact with them if he doesn¹t want to get isolated. Free improvisers come from very diverse backgrounds -- jazz (Cecil Taylor, Derek Bailey), rock (Thurston Moore), electronica (Fennesz, Jim O'Rourke, Voice Crack), even classical (Patrick Scheyer, Aki Takase) -- and perform in settings ranging from solo to large groups called creative orchestras.\n\nFree improvisation is not the same as free jazz, although some key musicians like Bailey and Taylor came from such a background. Free jazz often remained anchored in its originating idiom, using heads and licks to structure the improvised material. There is no such thing in free improvisation -- being freed of all rules, it cannot be traced back to a genre other than the very generic term \"avant-garde.\" As a style, free improv started to emerge in the late 1960s, mainly on the Berlin and London scenes, when people like Peter Brötzmann and the musicians revolving around (and trained by) John Stevens started to push American free jazz into more abstract territories. Brötzmann¹s 1968 LP Machine Gun shattered the world of free jazz and pioneered a form of improv characterized by extreme energy levels. Around Stevens and his Spontaneous Music Ensemble, a group of musicians developed an approach to improvisation relying on listening, toning down, trying to \"become\" the other musicians while being oneself, instead of attempting to outplay the other participants. This school of free improv is best exemplified by the productions released on the record label Emanem. In the late 1990s/early 2000s, an even more radical approach to free improvisation emerged, based on silence and the use of very short, very fragmented musical gestures. People like John Butcher, Axel Dörner, Franz Hautzinger and Radu Malfatti first explored these extremes.","songs":[{"id":"chtAyf7638","name":"Lost Rivers","artist":"VDfaaf4d"},{"id":"8GtQUKe2e33","name":"被困住的鲸","artist":"xFMYfmb6ed1"},{"id":"xL35i0b0b43","name":"釋","artist":"3PvC39fef"},{"id":"bf08vAf33cd2","name":"明月","artist":"xipZJYaf739"},{"id":"xNi8WVc0a1c","name":"Sunset avenue","artist":"nn9xb8919d6"},{"id":"xLyJ4kac865","name":"失群的鸟","artist":"iSTBaf895"},{"id":"xNY9hudfff0","name":"生僻字 伴奏","artist":"bC6WpU644855"},{"id":"8Irjb91b12f","name":"爱江山更爱美人 唯美改编钢琴独奏","artist":"b1CRYf53db36"},{"id":"xLt6Xhaa7d4","name":"落","artist":"c57Z29641"},{"id":"mQVdUG8cc36","name":"我叫贾宏声，我热爱摇滚乐","artist":"mwm5AK89ebf"},{"id":"ToYD7f1a7","name":"Milonga de Mis Amores","artist":"cJjh2e3d6"},{"id":"xL4JjS97d39","name":"十二月","artist":"nlhjbD52ac1"}],"albums":[{"id":"eHEW76e6f","name":"Lost Rivers","artist":"VDfaaf4d"},{"id":"b01hraw42d66","name":"Listen","artist":"xFMYfmb6ed1"},{"id":"xN5bVUf1246","name":"潮汐去","artist":"xipZJYaf739"},{"id":"8xtu0Lec6b9","name":"释 古琴","artist":"3PvC39fef"},{"id":"kI9nc70e6","name":"哭泣的太阳","artist":"iSTBaf895"},{"id":"b1C089N3d3d1","name":"羞羞的音符：流行音乐篇","artist":"b1CRYf53db36"},{"id":"xBUfWqa8fd3","name":"一箫逸曲","artist":"x5hjnVa0006"},{"id":"ky4r1c483","name":"Helianthus·葵","artist":"bEG9e6b3f"},{"id":"maSTgv78048","name":"飛音記","artist":"3PvC39fef"},{"id":"9cA4Fof8979","name":"The sentimental journey begins","artist":"nn9xb8919d6"},{"id":"bXxfWX6e5ac","name":"舜 古琴","artist":"3PvC39fef"},{"id":"nndYp488a80","name":"乡","artist":"iSTBaf895"}],"artists":[{"id":"VDfaaf4d","name":"Sainkho Namtchylak"},{"id":"byjv0i58085","name":"莫西子诗"},{"id":"bwiLf8f9b","name":"白水"},{"id":"EEA78266","name":"戸川純"},{"id":"cXr4ec6f","name":"常静"},{"id":"3PvC39fef","name":"曾小刚"},{"id":"xALLzm15ee6","name":"茄子蛋"},{"id":"3OL7516f","name":"灰野敬二"},{"id":"9Jd6be75","name":"梁奕源"},{"id":"bzyc1c676","name":"大友良英"},{"id":"bVuf1e9ec","name":"阿部薫"},{"id":"b23lfc2c8","name":"Kawabata Makoto"}]},{"type":"style","id":"699","name":"噪音 Noise","description":"就像这种音乐名字所启示的那样，噪音是泥泞的，生硬粗暴的，使人精疲力竭的。它为了开拓声波的攻击性，几乎完全摈弃了旋律和作曲技巧。从来自日本的Merzbow震耳欲聋，牙齿霍霍的攻击，到Amphetamine Reptile厂牌下乐队Tar 和Vertigo厚重，碾压式的紧张感，这是一种黑暗和残忍的音乐，将摇滚乐推向最远的极致。到了90年代末，50年代具象音乐中开创的正弦波死灰复燃，大批音乐家采用这种元素进行创作，比如大友良英。\n\nSludgy, abrasive, and punishing, Noise is everything its name promises, expanding on the music's capacity for sonic assault while almost entirely rejecting the role of melody and songcraft.

However, in this case, it refers mostly to electronic music as it took shape early on, when artists were still exploring the unique possibilities of electronically generated sound, as well as more recent music strongly indebted to those initial experiments. Avant-garde composers had long been fascinated with the ways technology could be used to produce previously unheard textures and combinations of sounds. French composer Edgard Varèse was a pioneer in this field, building his own electronic instruments as early as the 1920s and experimenting with tape loops during the '50s. Varèse's work was hugely influential on American avant-gardist John Cage and German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, both of whom greatly expanded the compositional structures in which electronic devices could be incorporated. But electronic music didn't really begin to enter the wider consciousness until around the 1970s, when sequencers and synthesizers became more affordable and easier to obtain. Wendy Carlos' 1968 Switched-On Bach album, a selection of Bach pieces performed on the Moog synthesizer, had ignited tremendous public attention, and Stockhausen's teachings had begun to inspire a burgeoning experimental music scene in Germany. Krautrock groups such as Can and Neu! integrated synthesizers and tape manipulations into their rabid experimentalism, but the two most important electronic artists to emerge from the scene were Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream. Kraftwerk pioneered the concept of pop music performed exclusively on synthesizers, and their robotic, mechanical, hypnotic style had a tremendous impact on nearly all electronic pop produced in the remainder of the 20th century. Tangerine Dream, meanwhile, was indebted to minimalist classical composition, crafting an atmospheric, slowly shifting, trance-inducing sound that helped invent the genre known as space music. Other crucial figures included Klaus Schulze, who explored a droning variation on space music that was even more trancelike than Tangerine Dream, and Brian Eno, whose inventive production and experiments with electronics in a pop context eventually gave way to his creation of ambient music, which aimed to blend thoroughly into its environment and often relied heavily on synthesizers. Ambient and space music helped give rise to new age, which emphasized the peaceful, soothing, and meditative qualities of those influences while adding greater melodicism; the progressive electronic branch of new age crafted a more dramatic, lushly orchestrated style that broke with electronic music's roots in minimalism. Synth-pop, techno, and its artier companion electronica all owed a great deal to the basic innovations of early electronic artists as well.","songs":[{"id":"xLomclf4ac2","name":"Got 2 Let

Radio Drama","description":"广播剧指由配音演员或播音员表演的戏剧或其他以话语为主的表演，通常通过广播电台放送或通过其他音频媒介（CD，磁带等）发行。\n\nRadio drama (or audio drama, audio play, radio play, radio theater) is a dramatized, purely acoustic performance, broadcast on radio or published on audio media, such as tape or CD. With no visual component, radio drama depends on dialogue, music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story: “It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension.”\n\nRadio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s. By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment. With the advent of television in the 1950s, however, radio drama lost some of its popularity, and in some countries has never regained large audiences. However, recordings of OTR (old-time radio) survive today in the audio archives of collectors and museums, as well as several online sites such as Internet Archive.\n\nAs of 2011, radio drama has a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States. Much of American radio drama is restricted to rebroadcasts or podcasts of programs from previous decades. However, other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama. In the United Kingdom, for example, the BBC produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on Radio 3, Radio 4, and Radio 4 Extra. Podcasting has also offered the means of creating new radio dramas, in addition to the distribution of vintage programs.\n\nThe terms \"audio drama\" or \"audio theatre\" are sometimes used synonymously with \"radio drama\" with one possible distinction: audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio. Audio drama, whether newly produced or OTR classics, can be found on CDs, cassette tapes, podcasts, webcasts and conventional broadcast radio.\n\nThanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution, radio drama is experiencing a revival.","songs":[{"id":"xLxYXwce8ef","name":"おまけ1","artist":"beWWd48e1"},{"id":"mQNkPI8f8e5","name":"ブランクトラック10秒","artist":"UaNjZe287ad"},{"id":"mQA48S5481a","name":"お電話","artist":"b5wWe2f95"},{"id":"mQTJ4A73486","name":"三只蝴蝶","artist":"bC14NX94aacf"},{"id":"xLy9dAd8dc8","name":"おまけ","artist":"FUy5dd4b"},{"id":"xLvj2eaf80c","name":"NorthWind and SunShine","artist":"bk5mce951"},{"id":"xL6EJAaf907","name":"寝息","artist":"NQT8d53f"},{"id":"JBeuJP1e387","name":"基础催眠","artist":"yhq08xdec12"},{"id":"mQRqwy59d2c","name":"長沙一分钟｜解放西","artist":"eERn90435"},{"id":"mQ7l0s84ade","name":"タイトルコール","artist":"b7NVfba81"}],"albums":[{"id":"gnsj7fa07","name":"ニャンコ先生 プレミアムボイス集","artist":"b5wWe2f95"},{"id":"jlrgDd5e18","name":"寻常计划","artist":"eERn90435"},{"id":"nmTif85e2e4","name":"彼と添い寝でしたいコトぜんぶ 永峰環","artist":"xo5CzBdef25"},{"id":"kEeyc110b","name":"憧れのシチュエーションCD vol.6 抱きしめられたいっ","artist":"beWWd48e1"},{"id":"9czsJke5bf3","name":"彩虹镇的故事","artist":"bC14NX94aacf"},{"id":"nmTjmw871f3","name":"听见長沙","artist":"eERn90435"},{"id":"xpRfRhc31cc","name":"跟你说晚安·2014年夏","artist":"yhq08xdec12"},{"id":"nhxEWn885fe","name":"TVアニメ「DRAMAtical Murder」オリジナルサ...","artist":"bi9Z97b62"},{"id":"USiPNP27009","name":"陪伴我们长大的国产动画片 陶笛智慧树","artist":"nmSy3i81ec6"},{"id":"yhEeXYa9f5a","name":"「SolidS」vol.3","artist":"bgrSabed9"},{"id":"nhNznt5f341","name":"ALIVE その1 Side.G","artist":"bgrSabed9"},{"id":"xqw5nA9f25f","name":"蒹葭情怀","artist":"YM3Nt3fd7f"}],"artists":[{"id":"beWWd48e1","name":"宮野真守"},{"id":"cMQz2d474","name":"神谷浩史"},{"id":"cvRs28376","name":"小野大輔"},{"id":"caxt2327f","name":"梶裕貴"},{"id":"eb1M4a69e","name":"櫻井孝宏"},{"id":"GNQ56112","name":"鈴木達央"},{"id":"dnJs3949f","name":"福山潤"},{"id":"biwMce1eb","name":"緑川光"},{"id":"LmX4f224","name":"立花慎之介"},{"id":"nnADDv89347","name":"狗子"},{"id":"FNB76648","name":"諏訪部順一"},{"id":"bk5mce951","name":"鳥海浩輔"}]}]},{"type":"genre","id":"14","name":"舞台 / 银幕 / 娱乐 Stage & Screen & Entertainment","description":"舞台 / 银幕 / 娱乐分类是一个特殊的风格分类，不以音乐特征为定义依据，而以音乐出现与使用的场景为风格定义依据，风格下的音乐具有明显的实用性、功能性。舞台 / 银幕 / 娱乐风格下主要包括非音乐类作品中出现、使用的音乐（例如原声带、音乐剧），以及明确针对特定场合场景、实用性特点强的音乐乃至录音制品（例如圣诞歌曲、演出金曲）。原声带等在非音乐作品中出现、使用的音乐亦具有明显的实用性、功能性。","songs":[{"id":"mQQ8TS78e31","name":"小幸运","artist":"K1z4dbb3"},{"id":"8HOEd2ee0b8","name":"追光者","artist":"blhU10d96"},{"id":"mQOJuY8b711","name":"See You Again","artist":"eFSC5ba6f"},{"id":"mSsZIA8e29e","name":"九张机","artist":"yiuePMd9a35"},{"id":"ckB1Wf7591","name":"一生所爱","artist":"iuzfce26"},{"id":"bf0Fx8U504a4","name":"一次就好","artist":"e5v7ff17"},{"id":"xLJGeccb18f","name":"全世界谁倾听你","artist":"6in9397a"},{"id":"xL6psSb6c2a","name":"小苹果","artist":"bBr4e2037"},{"id":"xL3lYrdb9f1","name":"안녕","artist":"byYgF166464"},{"id":"xNcO5hbd1ea","name":"我喜欢上你时的内心活动","artist":"f9yaaafc"},{"id":"xL1JxTab756","name":"我的天空","artist":"bFTl1a3be"},{"id":"xLA5U39699f","name":"Victory","artist":"bisAd86ee"}],"albums":[{"id":"mjF0OC66ba4","name":"我的少女时代 电影歌曲原声带","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"nndWLe5fea9","name":"夏至未至 电视原声带","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"xG72vGc63fa","name":"园游音效库作品展播","artist":"8kiqJMf9f56"},{"id":"nmTWVh69be0","name":"微微一笑很倾城 电视原声大碟","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"b2iZ8k86e6a","name":"你曾是少年","artist":"fXRb70bd"},{"id":"88Y961ae","name":"仙剑奇侠传 电视原声带","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"yhEgN0b8c7a","name":"夏洛特烦恼 电影原声带","artist":"iUvTa8a5f"},{"id":"nneblq831b3","name":"九张机","artist":"yiuePMd9a35"},{"id":"eTYK5b5f2","name":"齐天周大圣之西游双记","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"b8xHfG13f01","name":"Furious 7 (Original Motion Pic...","artist":"WeU99a9d"},{"id":"bBRGt2W483a9","name":"별에서 온 그대 O.S.T","artist":"bAlN19c4c"},{"id":"b1CmS5l3fd68","name":"全世界谁倾听你","artist":"6in9397a"}],"artists":[{"id":"gg7vy72cadf","name":"金玟岐"},{"id":"jArffa9d","name":"久石譲"},{"id":"bAlN19c4c","name":"韩国原声带"},{"id":"GMu6fa60","name":"梶浦由記"},{"id":"jCJe8641","name":"S.E.N.S."},{"id":"bfAPa0758","name":"澤野弘之"},{"id":"wFM3e0c3","name":"原声带"},{"id":"bzsc1994b","name":"Hans Zimmer"},{"id":"WeU99a9d","name":"Soundtrack"},{"id":"gWPc4394","name":"坂本龍一"},{"id":"bisAd86ee","name":"Two Steps From Hell"},{"id":"8xk965ed","name":"菅野よう子"}],"styles":[{"type":"style","id":"746","name":"原声 Soundtrack","description":"原声即电影、电视剧等电视节目、游戏、书等作品中所使用的音乐，通常是无人声演唱或不以人声演唱为主的背景音乐，也包括这些作品中使用的歌曲。\n\nA soundtrack can be recorded music accompanying and synchronized to the images of a motion picture, book, television program or video game; a commercially released soundtrack album of music as featured in the soundtrack of a film or TV show; or the physical area of a film that contains the synchronized recorded sound.\n\nIn movie industry terminology usage, a sound track is an audio recording created or used in film production or post-production. Initially the dialogue, sound effects, and music in a film each has its own separate track (dialogue track, sound effects track, and music track), and these are mixed together to make what is called the composite track, which is heard in the film. A dubbing track is often later created when films are dubbed into another language. This is also known as a M & E track (music and effects) containing all sound elements minus dialogue which is then supplied by the foreign distributor in the native language of its territory.\n\nThe contraction soundtrack came into public consciousness with the advent of so-called \"soundtrack albums\" in the late 1940s. First conceived by movie companies as a promotional gimmick for new films, these commercially available recordings were labeled and advertised as \"music from the original motion picture soundtrack\", or \"music from and inspired by the motion picture.\" These phrases was soon shortened to just \"original motion picture soundtrack.\" More accurately, such recordings are made from a film's music track, because they usually consist of the isolated music from a film, not the composite (sound) track with dialogue and sound effects.\n\nThe abbreviation OST is often used to describe the musical soundtrack on a recorded medium, such as CD, and it stands for Original Soundtrack; however, it is sometimes also used to differentiate the original music heard and recorded versus a rerecording or cover of the music.","songs":[{"id":"mQOJuY8b711","name":"See You Again","artist":"eFSC5ba6f"},{"id":"ckB1Wf7591","name":"一生所爱","artist":"iuzfce26"},{"id":"xL6psSb6c2a","name":"小苹果","artist":"bBr4e2037"},{"id":"mSQITa74247","name":"卡路里","artist":"yivvY1bca20"},{"id":"bA9oee0d8","name":"虫儿飞 (儿童合唱版)","artist":"9dgkRre28fe"},{"id":"8G0d8kf188f","name":"看淡","artist":"K1z4dbb3"},{"id":"mQVmpQ88cda","name":"Try Everything","artist":"5DQ944f2"},{"id":"ZnOb97eb","name":"拥有","artist":"FHL5e8fa"},{"id":"Cti91f6d","name":"相思","artist":"qhV34164"},{"id":"mQGyw8cadaf","name":"致青春","artist":"fLHae5f8"},{"id":"mQUzPU4d76a","name":"可念不可说","artist":"iO2hda95e"},{"id":"fEsgl3f574","name":"美丽的神话Ⅰ","artist":"8Fb3fa2"}],"albums":[{"id":"88Y961ae","name":"仙剑奇侠传 电视原声带","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"eTYK5b5f2","name":"齐天周大圣之西游双记","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"b8xHfG13f01","name":"Furious 7 (Original Motion Pic...","artist":"WeU99a9d"},{"id":"flfM586e0","name":"武侠音乐精装特辑","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"c5Kj54bb04e","name":"老男孩之猛龙过江 电影原声","artist":"bBr4e2037"},{"id":"nmTxdI8a48e","name":"秦时明月 电视原声带","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"bfgRXvd2ef0d","name":"Frozen (Original Motion Pictur...","artist":"WeU99a9d"},{"id":"czicmFe02da","name":"Begin Again (Music From and In...","artist":"WeU99a9d"},{"id":"nmTyBw4f8fb","name":"万万没想到 电影原声带","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"9cEDkSfff52","name":"西虹市首富 电影原声","artist":"oWeW2d1a6b"},{"id":"oVwW4d9da0","name":"何以笙箫默 电视原声带","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"nnd6u77160b","name":"La La Land (Original Motion Pi...","artist":"9dfeSYfdd6c"}],"artists":[{"id":"jArffa9d","name":"久石譲"},{"id":"GMu6fa60","name":"梶浦由記"},{"id":"jCJe8641","name":"S.E.N.S."},{"id":"bfAPa0758","name":"澤野弘之"},{"id":"wFM3e0c3","name":"原声带"},{"id":"bzsc1994b","name":"Hans Zimmer"},{"id":"WeU99a9d","name":"Soundtrack"},{"id":"gWPc4394","name":"坂本龍一"},{"id":"8xk965ed","name":"菅野よう子"},{"id":"PQ17b69","name":"范宗沛"},{"id":"WoSd3bd2","name":"Ólafur Arnalds"},{"id":"cCsp2d735","name":"Ennio Morricone"}]},{"type":"style","id":"747","name":"电影原声 Film Score","description":"电影原声其原意是指电影声音中的音乐轨（另外还有对白、音效等，都录制在不同的音轨上），但现在已经泛指因电影而发行的音乐唱片，可以分成以下3种基本型态： 　\n 1.以歌曲为主的歌曲原声唱片（Song-Oriented Soundtrack Album） 这是最常见的一种Soundtrack，因为其商业利益比纯配乐唱片要高出很多倍。绝大多数时候，这些歌曲都是现成品，但也有一些是真正为电影而创作的原著歌曲，比如《毕业生》是最典型的例子。 　　\n 2.以配乐为主体的原声唱片（Original Dramatic Scores On Record） 真正将电影中的音乐轨直接翻录成唱片的情况很少，一般原声唱片发行时，是将原始的Soundtrack进行删减并重新组合编排，以达到音乐的流畅性和完整感。但也有不是取自原始Original Soundtrack，而是音乐家根据配乐原谱，重新为发行唱片而特别选曲，有时还会重新改写编辑，重新演绎灌录，而这往往是大片巨制的做法。 　　\n 3.没有使用在电影中，但挂名为电影原声唱片的音乐专辑（Music Inspired by Motion Picture） 这当然是一种纯商业行为，而且也已经越来越普遍，甚至一部完全没有音乐的电影也会发行原声唱片。还有一种情况是“落选配乐”Rejected Score，就是音乐家已经完成的作品，最后没有使用在电影中，后来又发行了电影原声唱片，最著名的例子是Alex North为《2001年太空漫游》所做的“落选配乐”。 　　\n以上只是3种基本型态，而实际上很多原声唱片是混合型的，其中混合了歌曲（不管它是否真的出现过）、原著配乐、演奏单曲等，甚至会有没有使用在电影里的音乐片段，以及电影中的音效对白等。而且，一部电影可能会发行好几张不同形态、不同版本的原声唱片。 \n\n\nFilm Music works in conjunction with dialogue and image to establish the mood and tone of a movie; classical, jazz, electronic — regardless of genre, any material composed or scored expressly for use in a motion picture can be defined as film music.

Frenzied and impassioned, Stalling's work broke new ground by following the visual trajectory of the on-screen action instead of the accepted rules of composition. The result — a technique not anchored in conventional senses of time, rhythm, or thematic development — was unprecedented in its extremism, as melody, style, and form crashed together in a glorious pile-up of sound and image perfectly attuned to the crazed imagery it underscored. Stalling's WB music created the basic formula which cartoon scores continue to follow even today, although from the rock era onward, more conventional pop songs have also played a key role in animated productions as well. Many series (like Josie & the Pussycats and Jabberjaw) have focused on fictional rock bands, while latter-day Disney productions have featured scores by pop stars including Elton John and Phil Collins.","songs":[{"id":"JANbZQ24258","name":"蓝精灵","artist":"bjXL9980f"},{"id":"xLpaBQ13bf0","name":"葫芦金刚","artist":"ueF379d0"},{"id":"xNiAGpa43d7","name":"葫芦娃","artist":"MFg7bd06"},{"id":"8HIEPqfddbd","name":"The Bing Bong Song","artist":"yhMdApd48f0"},{"id":"8Geb98e3e26","name":"雷欧之歌","artist":"dG6Z42eef"},{"id":"mQ4PZH6f6dc","name":"别看我只是一只羊","artist":"cNhf33098"},{"id":"8FZOXGea565","name":"アシタカせっ記","artist":"jArffa9d"},{"id":"b4DvL987a4","name":"春田花花幼稚园校歌","artist":"nf8ff2c2f"},{"id":"Vvth51875","name":"A Whole New World ","artist":"dabf3821f"},{"id":"bCkRVn643f1f","name":"菊次郎的夏天-Summer","artist":"8b1aYDe1e33"},{"id":"8GiIMMf44a9","name":"霞光","artist":"bBpD18d51"},{"id":"b1pObv23cdbf","name":"生日快乐","artist":"yiul5yb6423"}],"albums":[{"id":"kbxlcc943","name":"经典动画歌曲大赏","artist":"bjXL9980f"},{"id":"nndxIX595f0","name":"Peppa Pig Songs (From the TV S...","artist":"yhMdApd48f0"},{"id":"kgYL9dc8e","name":"我叫MT 动画原声带","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"fAJZ95111","name":"秦时明月 原声大碟","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"jgfncc73c","name":"麦兜故事 电影原声大碟","artist":"3NKt39163"},{"id":"eTTn69822","name":"麦兜菠萝油王子 电影原声大碟","artist":"3NKt39163"},{"id":"yhP5Yqbc72f","name":"葫芦兄弟 86版原声音乐","artist":"MFg7bd06"},{"id":"0HvF2dd51","name":"喜羊羊与灰太狼之虎虎生威 电影原声大碟","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"D9k845187","name":"雷欧之歌","artist":"dG6Z42eef"},{"id":"jLQTa3883","name":"Aladdin (Original Motion Pictu...","artist":"Gc774c4c"},{"id":"knlqdf337","name":"爱的声响","artist":"cCU6HAbb7ff"},{"id":"jXv2Ni46908","name":"时光·掠影","artist":"8b1aYDe1e33"}],"artists":[{"id":"wFM3e0c3","name":"原声带"},{"id":"WeU99a9d","name":"Soundtrack"},{"id":"6eb7fb31","name":"日本原声带"},{"id":"kdAEqg499a8","name":"Kyle Xian"},{"id":"neFe1dda3","name":"其他原声带"},{"id":"cCU6HAbb7ff","name":"薄荷映像"},{"id":"bfaKAoC3342b","name":"十方"},{"id":"x1N6Lwb92da","name":"tamaSakura"},{"id":"bC7EXMB4653c","name":"GS"},{"id":"dPfE47df9","name":"Raymond Scott"},{"id":"yhDvN2bddab","name":"风流先森"},{"id":"cX4FCUce572","name":"郭好为"}]},{"type":"style","id":"754","name":"游戏配乐 Video Game Music","description":"游戏被称为第九种艺术，是各项艺术的完美集合体。游戏是一个独立的、完整的世界。这个缔造的世界里面，音乐是不可或缺的因素。游戏的玩家在探索着未知的游戏世界时，在一张张完全不同的游戏地图里面徘徊探索，完全融入了那个世界里面。音乐有着不可或却的作用。\n在九十年代之前，游戏音乐是由Trent Reznor、Fluke这样的音乐家创作的，他们正视舞曲、电子乐及摇滚。而且，早期的游戏音乐中暗示出的重复、如催眠一般的节奏被证明奠定了现代舞曲的根基。\nVideo Game Music refers to the tinny, electronic music that is played in the background during video games.

The story and emotional content of a musical – humor, pathos, love, anger – are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals.\n\nAlthough music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America. These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan. The Princess Theatre musicals and other smart shows like Of Thee I Sing (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as Show Boat (1927) and Oklahoma! (1943). Some of the most famous and iconic musicals through the decades that followed include West Side Story (1957), The Fantasticks (1960), Hair (1967), A Chorus Line (1975), Les Misérables (1985), The Phantom of the Opera (1986), Rent (1994), The Producers (2001) and Wicked (2003).\n\nMusicals are performed all around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big budget West End and Broadway theatre productions in London and New York, or in smaller fringe theatre, Off-Broadway or regional theatre productions, on tour, or by amateur groups in schools, theatres and other performance spaces. In addition to Britain and North America, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in many countries in Europe, Latin America, Australasia and Asia.","songs":[{"id":"ckE6mf8a01","name":"Nocturne","artist":"WkLb5c03"},{"id":"xNdvQfd7f61","name":"刹那的乌托邦","artist":"blhU10d96"},{"id":"mQ3uXS79fdc","name":"Le temps des cathédrales","artist":"bgbba3b4a"},{"id":"cpOkoed434","name":"被雨伤透","artist":"e3t81558"},{"id":"bCk8rOC4ab0b","name":"Wenn ich tanzen will","artist":"b6KKfb1c0"},{"id":"8GpfzDf109d","name":"Moon River","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"xL4T2dc29cc","name":"Edelweiss","artist":"nnboty55259"},{"id":"fScZ5c0ce","name":"雨中的操场(DEMO版)","artist":"x9NT57130d6"},{"id":"J3751be6","name":"爱是永恒","artist":"xIW446b0"},{"id":"OJ9b55373","name":"Naturaleza Muerta","artist":"WkIe0014"},{"id":"xLFyrAb0445","name":"告别之前","artist":"hgScf1df"},{"id":"8FZwsMe413e","name":"Mamma Mia","artist":"bcOTb9b53"}],"albums":[{"id":"eUno723db","name":"Inside I'm Singing","artist":"WkLb5c03"},{"id":"jNmccd57d","name":"Notre-Dame de Paris","artist":"b6hzeea99"},{"id":"jSLAab18c","name":"Elisabeth: Die Highlights der ...","artist":"cTqI32869"},{"id":"nndECI7e519","name":"刹那的乌托邦 原声大碟","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"muz8Y7710b8","name":"午夜剧院","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"jyzee2de","name":"雪狼湖","artist":"xIW446b0"},{"id":"ele94b42","name":"雪狼湖 创意音乐剧国语版","artist":"xIW446b0"},{"id":"8Dn782d8","name":"听见花开 音乐剧原声","artist":"wFM3e0c3"},{"id":"fBvvd30fe","name":"Mamma Mia! 5th Anniversary","artist":"WeU99a9d"},{"id":"nQ4rf39b4","name":"几米向左走·向右走 音乐剧配乐原声带","artist":"xd88426"},{"id":"yhE2iUe17b7","name":"스쿨오즈 - 홀로그램 뮤지컬 O.S.T","artist":"bAlN19c4c"},{"id":"wWsA5sdcb7d","name":"Elisabeth - Das Musical - Gesa...","artist":"cTqI32869"}],"artists":[{"id":"bourbadc1","name":"阿鲲"},{"id":"xd88426","name":"几米"},{"id":"bfqxd462d","name":"Andrew Lloyd Webber"},{"id":"buvf17fbd","name":"Barbra Streisand"},{"id":"b5G4tt7e18d","name":"宝塚歌劇団"},{"id":"dBWP41871","name":"闫月"},{"id":"iTor15c00","name":"罗威"},{"id":"bqssysn3568d","name":"景德镇文艺复兴"},{"id":"xUgHiC115c1","name":"High School Musical Cast"},{"id":"d5lY41585","name":"Julie Andrews"},{"id":"bfaKAoC3342b","name":"十方"},{"id":"xnw2omde550","name":"傲日格乐"}]},{"type":"style","id":"765","name":"歌舞剧 Cabaret","description":"暂无","songs":[{"id":"bf0AXcl3354d","name":"采薇","artist":"xwGgh4ddba6"},{"id":"fB3dj403e6","name":"A Morning in Cornwall","artist":"AKw86a89"},{"id":"mQ4pHk79305","name":"Do Do Do","artist":"bwFte1d78"},{"id":"8GpfzDf109d","name":"Moon River","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"b0pzsbcea4","name":"La Chanson de Prévert","artist":"2FG70f7a"},{"id":"bCkFWiY4ab93","name":"雀之灵","artist":"3d59a12"},{"id":"U55YGj2660a","name":"Why Try to Change Me Now","artist":"btBFf49fe"},{"id":"bqvdnrw371ca","name":"Mon Amant de Saint Jean","artist":"91n85dc1"},{"id":"8IuoAHeb556","name":"Warm up","artist":"dbJ8Fb14baf"},{"id":"SVJd11ac","name":"歌剧魅影","artist":"ciD429ea"},{"id":"goRzW49fcd","name":"Coin-Operated Boy","artist":"6Os61cd6"},{"id":"cltjzf3f9c","name":"La Bohème","artist":"Xk3d4ca2"}],"albums":[{"id":"buHbvt7bf44","name":"采薇","artist":"xwGgh4ddba6"},{"id":"muz8Y7710b8","name":"午夜剧院","artist":"hgja759c"},{"id":"jz94121ce","name":"Paradiesvogel","artist":"AKw86a89"},{"id":"yhTlqge0b4c","name":"张康明芭蕾课堂音乐","artist":"dbJ8Fb14baf"},{"id":"sqc723637","name":"Normal as Blueberry Pie: A Tri...","artist":"bwFte1d78"},{"id":"8BKdmTe86ea","name":"足迹","artist":"xwGgh4ddba6"},{"id":"9czO1Ye8764","name":"舞剧《昭君出塞》音乐","artist":"xwGgh4ddba6"},{"id":"gj9V7a038","name":"云南印象 原生态歌舞集音乐精选","artist":"3d59a12"},{"id":"9cz3Aie8999","name":"书简／逍遥","artist":"xwGgh4ddba6"},{"id":"fn0d5209a","name":"Tango","artist":"AKw86a89"},{"id":"bTQ721b7d","name":"L'  Etonnant Serge Gainsbourg","artist":"2FG70f7a"},{"id":"waam2656f","name":"Romantic Dreams","artist":"AKw86a89"}],"artists":[{"id":"buE91942c","name":"Jane Birkin"},{"id":"ckG927da5","name":"Edith Piaf"},{"id":"FpN739d4","name":"Gérard Darmon"},{"id":"2FG70f7a","name":"Serge Gainsbourg"},{"id":"xwGgh4ddba6","name":"张渠"},{"id":"b5G4tt7e18d","name":"宝塚歌劇団"},{"id":"OGc60280","name":"René Aubry"},{"id":"Yfsc835e","name":"Marlene Dietrich"},{"id":"buNk17d7f","name":"Patricia Barber"},{"id":"EKU963f0","name":"Andrea Ross"},{"id":"b7Owf9e8a","name":"Владимир Высоцкий"},{"id":"UDH13b3f","name":"Jacques Brel"}]},{"type":"style","id":"761","name":"演出金曲 Show Tunes","description":"Show Tunes是从音乐戏剧和电影精选出的曲目。这些歌曲通常由专业的词曲作者创作，并且由演绎传统曲调的演员或歌手演唱。百老汇音乐剧产生出大量不同的歌曲，前奏曲、间奏曲、后奏曲、主题曲。任何一首出自百老汇的歌曲都可以被认为是Show Tunes. are the songs that have been featured in musical plays and films.
