# ArchivedXiami

Very few data of dying [xiami.com](https://www.xiami.com/), archived for memorial purpose.  
即将归于虚无的[虾米音乐](https://www.xiami.com/)之沧海一粟。

> Due to the shortage of time and machines, most capture plans has been abandoned. Comments are the main subject.

## Browse data

Data are provided as PPMd compressed files in the release page and `/archive/` (partial).

* `pool.json`: data pool for detailed artists, albums, songs and comments data.
* `genre.json`: archive of the main pages in the genre and style section.
* `collect.json`: detailed data of some popular collections.

Tools may be needed to decompress and browse some huge JSON files.

## Begin capture

Scripts are in `/source/`.

Copy the plain HTML code in `/source/standalone/template.html`, open a page in [xiami.com](https://www.xiami.com/list) and enter ``javascript:`<paste here>` `` in the navigation bar of the page to create a workspace for capturing.
